#Why did alumni choose to come to Grinnell?

<Paragraph or so of intro from the website>

Within this repository we have a variety of source and code files.

All python files, csv files, text files, excel files, North_Header.jpeg, and markdown files, as well as the written content and some design of the website, are by the authors (Philip Kiely and Noah Daniel). These materials are released under the MIT license that covers this project.

The original, unmodified index.html, vendor, and css folders are from https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/blog-post/ and used under the MIT license. This project in turn was built on HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and JQuery, all appropriately licensed for use in the template and in turn our project.

The Alumni history transcripts in output and backup folders, as well as all other images, historical sources, and secondary sources, are copyright of their respective author(s). They are used according to fair use and cited appropriately in the website itself. All primary sources are from https://digital.grinnell.edu.
