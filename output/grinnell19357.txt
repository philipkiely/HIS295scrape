Alenka Figa::  Ready.
Phil Bertenthal::  My name is Phil Bertenthal, currently live in Los Angeles, California, and I’m a member of the Grinnell College class of 1968. The first time I ever came to Grinnell was as a freshman. I had never visited the college, never interviewed with anybody from the college, did everything by written application, and other than a magazine article in Life magazine in 1960, I didn’t know almost anything about Grinnell, other than it was a good, small college.
Phil Bertenthal::  I arrived with a cousin of mine who I had never met before that day. We flew to Chicago and then hopped on a train, and- I don’t know how we got from the airport to the train; I just don’t remember that part. And we took the Rock Island line into Grinnell. Just wanna look at the yearbook- thing- I remember arriving on the Rock Island line, and then a bus took me to my dorm, and a guy in the dorms saw me and knew my name because he had memorized the names of all the freshman in our dorm and said, “Hi Phil, how are you?” and I went up to my dorm.
Phil Bertenthal::  So that’s my first memory of the campus. So, I thought everybody was really friendly, I mean, somebody I didn’t know knew my name and that was kind cool, and then I met my roommates. There was another New Yorker in my room and a kid from Des Moines, with his- with a blazer and a tie, which nobody else was wearing a blazer and a tie. And I said, “This guy is kind of different than me.” He wound up becoming my roommate for three years and we’re still pretty good friends. So, that was kind of my first memory of Grinnell.
Phil Bertenthal::  Grinnell, for me, was not very much of an academic place. I did not have the best class attendance or the best grades. I was lucky as a child, being smart, and I was able to really skate through in many ways academically, and spent much of my time on other activities at Grinnell. I was primarily involved in Student Government my last two years.
Phil Bertenthal::  But other than that I really spent my time just kind of learning about things and talking to people. I would stay up all night, ‘till maybe three, four, five, six o’clock in the morning, fall asleep before breakfast, and wake up after lunch. And then just getting back in my routine, I played a lot of bridge in the Forum, in the room between the.... Grill and the North Lounge, and then- until I got involved, like I say, in the student government my last two years, here....
Phil Bertenthal & Alenka Figa::  My f-
Phil Bertenthal::  I.. I was just kind of surprised, but the life in the dorms, the men’s dorms, was incredibly fraternity-like: lots of hazing, lots of drinking, a lot of partying... Lots of not being nice to people who were different, and that continued throughout my four years there, slowly dropping. There was one event that had been a major Grinnell event for like 100 years that got eliminated my freshman year because the year before the men were so unruly, and so men’s hall life was kind of, really wild, out of control, and very much non-political.
Alenka Figa & Phil Bertenthal::  What was – I guess, depending on if you’re comfortable saying – what was the event that was banned?
Phil Bertenthal & Alenka Figa::  Every spring we had a thing called Spring Riot, which was unofficially sanctioned by the administration where outgoing Student Government, which was no longer in power because it was after spring break, would kidnap the incoming Student Government and take them to the College’s campus, a cabin at Rock Creek. And all the electricity would be turned off on campus and there would just be parties going along.
Phil Bertenthal::  So that all was happening at Grinnell. At the same time, there was all this political consciousness going on. So it was really very strange. We became very much anti-war activists, so it was almost strange kind of being, on one hand, being in this kind of, y'know, late-fifties, early sixties, kind of, almost Animal House existence on North Campus, and this really serious, political stuff going on, primarily anti-war stuff but other things as well and people really serious about it and really concerned about it. And it was just really interesting.
Phil Bertenthal & Alenka Figa::  When I came as a freshman I don’t think there was almost any drugs on campus, except…
Phil Bertenthal::  But there was... you know, by my sophomore year there was a lot of- that started, more my junior year. A number of folks went out to San Francisco for the summer of 1967 and I remember they brought back lots of LSD. There was lots of LSD on campus. So there's- by the time I graduated it was weird because the freshman were coming in very very drug savvy; even more drug savvy than we were because we were isolated in Iowa. So the freshman and sophomores were even more drug savvy than the juniors and seniors were during those years. ‘Cause when we got to Grinnell there was, firstly, no drugs. There was a lot of drinking, but not a lot of drugs. So that was kind of...
Phil Bertenthal::  The other thing about dorm life was when we got here, women had hours. Freshman women had to be in by 10:30 during the week and midnight on weekends. Freshman men could stay out all night from the very first time they arrived on campus. Yeah, one of my early memories was going to the Dixie Diner which was on 6th just on the other side of Park Street.
Phil Bertenthal & Alenka Figa::  Because, at that time.. Well, the- Highway 6 was the main east-west road in the United States, and a month after- We would go there at 4:00 in the morning and get these wonderfully homemade sweet rolls just fresh from the oven, which the women never got to eat. But then they opened up Interstate 80 about two mon- some time in that first semester.
Phil Bertenthal & Alenka Figa::  So, where was I?
Phil Bertenthal & Alenka Figa::  And so it was more.. so the house- and there was a lot of self-governance, but only to the extent that the students got to enforce the rules, but the administration made the rules. So, it was all- no, well, things were very restricted. There was… women were not allowed- you couldn't have a member of the opposite sex in your room except on Sunday afternoons between 2 and 5, and only if the door was opened at least the width of a towel and at least three feet were on the floor at all times.
Phil Bertenthal & Alenka Figa::  So, Student Government- so part of Student Government dealt with just enforcing the rules that nobody believed in. The best places to live became the basements because the basements were easily accessible. You can get people in and out of your room with the fewest people seeing you, so those became the prime rooms which I’m sure now, basements are probably no longer prime rooms because you can have anybody in your room whenever you want.
Phil Bertenthal::  So that’s- So, one of the things we did with Student Government, my senior year I was speaker of the Student Senate and I was on the group, we got rid of... I mean, the administration, senior year- Let's see, sophomore year they got rid of freshman women’s hours. So, they had the same hours as all other women, which I think was midnight all the time, maybe one AM. I think midnight.
Phil Bertenthal::  So senior year, they eliminated women’s hours. The loggia, which was locked at midnight, became unlocked all the time. In part becau- It was locked from the inside, but what happened was students got a very clever thing, they filed a fire department complaint, and the fire department found that it was a fire hazard, having the women locked in, so that’s how they got the loggia opened at night, the women’s loggia open.
Phil Bertenthal & Alenka Figa::  But one of the things which happened was, and for years I thought it was us, that the students had demanded, came up with this idea. “We want to integrate the campus, have co-ed dorms.” And while there was a lot of support amongst some of the students, really the push for that actually came from the administration.
Alenka Figa & Phil Bertenthal::  And that was the hazing?
Phil Bertenthal::  So... But, so there was getting to be the feeling among the students, I guess, as we were becoming more sophisticated and more political, that really what was happening was not any good. But, the administration really didn’t like it, liked it far less than we did, and so, when the idea came up I think it was as much an administration idea as much as a student idea, and it was actually opposed, probably... The biggest opposition to it probably came from the men on North campus. Because you were gonna break up our way of life, our hall.
Phil Bertenthal::  I mean, I lived in North Younker and I got driven back from the airport by two women who recently graduated. They said, “Oh, we lived in Younker.” And I said, “You lived in Younkers? Did you live in South Younker or North Younker?” because those were two different worlds, they were two different cultures, two different groups of people. And somebody was from South Younker or North Younker, nobody was from Younkers. And so, the whole idea that- y'know, that’s, like a big big change. So that’s one of the things we did, is we worked on the changes in the- in terms of the residence hall, worked on the plans to integrate. And from- I’ve talked to folks from ’69 and ’70 who were here afterwards and they said that the changeover actually went very very smoothly, and..
Phil Bertenthal & Alenka Figa::  Though it’s interesting, my understanding is, not having been a student here since, is that North campus still retains a little bit more of its character over 45 years after the campuses were integrated.
Alenka Figa & Phil Bertenthal::  Oh, just- I have a quick question. So, the hazing culture that was here in the early sixties- right? Was that tied to athletics, or was that just like-?
Alenka Figa & Phil Bertenthal::  So in your time at Grinnell, how did the.. like, the level of power or authority that student government had change? Or did it?
Phil Bertenthal & Alenka Figa::  And part of it was, that we did- there was pressure though, to change the rules. I mean, there was a lot of pressure from the women students about women’s hours and the whole idea of it just being fundamentally not right. And, y'know- and somebody said, “I’ve seen this picture of the boys and the girls from that time. Y'know, it’s the boys who should’ve been locked up at night.” But, basically, the thing was, if you lock up the girls then the boys can’t get themselves in trouble kind of attitude.
Alenka Figa & Phil Bertenthal::  So what was your position in Student Government?
Phil Bertenthal & Alenka Figa::  The Marvelettes which were a great Motown group did “Please Mr. Postman”-
Alenka Figa & Phil Bertenthal::  Were you involved in any like, protest movements, or anything sort of outside the realm of Grinnell politics?
Phil Bertenthal & Alenka Figa::  But, so... There wasn’t that much protest going on. There was a smaller group, and we did- Though, my senior year, the folks who were really political did some- probably, I don’t know if you’ve ever seen, this is one of the great pictures of all time. The Marine recruiters were coming on campus and there was a lot of violent reaction to Marine recruiters coming on campus. What they did here on Grinnell is, the field between ARH and the Forum – and the Forum at that time was the center of campus life.
Phil Bertenthal & Alenka Figa::  On the cam- On this open field between ARH and the Forum they put small white crosses up the entire field with the names of all the men of the senior class on the crosses-
Phil Bertenthal::  But I didn’t do very much political protest. I think, well, part of it was the- A lot of the direct protest really didn’t start until after, I think, the Chicago convention in 1968, the summer of ‘68. ‘Cause I think what happened was, until then people thought maybe we can pull it off and stuff. And you- working on the, y’know, if you’re working on the McCarthy campaign or the Bobby Kennedy campaign you think, " Okay, this is gonna do it. We’re gonna really change it." You know?
Phil Bertenthal::  And then, ‘68 was a hard year. First you had- Martin Luther King Jr. was shot and then you had- Bobby Kennedy was shot right after graduation. So, it was a really hard time, and I remember when Martin Luther King Jr was shot, the person we were scheduled to have on campus, John Lewis, who’s now a congressman from Georgia but at that time I think was head of the Student Non-violent Coordinating, was supposed to show up, I think that night or the next night and so that got canceled.
Phil Bertenthal::  And it was just- It was just a really hard time, especially, starting with our senior year in high school when Bobby Kenn- when John Kennedy was shot, to have to go through all that, to have all of these different inspirational leaders, you know, be killed. It really, I think, cut out a lot of- And I think the protest movement started really getting violent at that point, after 1968.
Alenka Figa & Phil Bertenthal::  Do you have any specific memories of, maybe, like, right after Martin Luther King Jr. was shot, or after Kennedy’s assassination?
Phil Bertenthal & Alenka Figa::  I remember that. I remember after Martin Luther King Jr. was shot it was the first time I had ever been in Herrick chapel.
Alenka Figa & Phil Bertenthal::  I guess this is a tangent, but did Herrick have sort of more.. more of a religious affiliation? ‘Cause now I- we see it more as a venue for like, concerts and things like that.
Alenka Figa & Phil Bertenthal::  This is- I'm gonna pull from all over the place, sorry. You mentioned homecoming, and we don’t have a homecoming celebration or anything anymore. So, could you talk about that?
Phil Bertenthal & Alenka Figa::  The football stadium was there and, y'know, we had cheerleaders then, and we had a homecoming queen. It was very very classic, and then that Saturday night you had a dance in Darby and it was just like- y'know, if you go over and look at the '66 yearbook you can see the coronation of Laurie Houdek, the 1966 homecoming queen. And then right behind her is my good friend Laurie Hill who is one of the homecoming princesses, who was- I think she was a cheerleader. She may have been captain of the cheerleading team. She went from there to becoming-
Phil Bertenthal::  So, but that’s what it was. It was just like any other, y’know... You had the homecoming dance. You had the homecoming event. They always had a cross country meet at the same time. It always would start before the football game, or during the football game, and then it would always end- the race would end- They would come back into the stadium- it always happened during halftime at the football game. Well, sometimes not, and sometimes the train would go through the campus during the football games and people would put signs on the train. But I mean, homecoming was... it was... it disappeared but I don’t think homecoming was- I don’t remember it as being an unusually rowdy event. It just seemed, it was kind of an old-fashioned kind of event, except we had modern music. Like I said, we had the Jefferson Airplane and the Marvelettes the last two years.
Alenka Figa & Phil Bertenthal::  So would you say Grinnell was more typical, had more like, what you would expect out of a bigger university campus before…?
Phil Bertenthal::  I mean, it was as academically focused as it is today. The students were- there was almost this weird dichotomy between what was happening, at least with many of the students, not all the students, ‘cause there were a lot of students, y'know, who didn’t partake in that. But, there was still a lot of that happening, but there was also a lot of serious scholarship going on. Y'know, we were getting a lot- y'know- The campus was not as focused and stuff- on all these national kinds of things that we have, but we had really excellent people doing all kinds of really, really incredible things, so..
Phil Bertenthal::  I think we were different and I think when we gr- y'know we... I mean, when we graduated we felt that we were different, and I know that those of us in the class of ’68 think that we're- not only do we think that Grinnellians are different but we think that the class of ’68 is different. We think that we somehow are the epitome of Grinnellians ‘cause we were there for the change. We fostered the campus through the change. Y'know?
Alenka Figa & Phil Bertenthal::  I guess- Can you elaborate a little on what “the change” means? Or-
Phil Bertenthal::  And I’m guessing issues of sexuality kind of came after that, but- y'know. 'Cause when I was there… now I realize who was gay, some of my friends who were gay. But back then, there was- nobody was out. Nobody was out at Grinnell then. And I don’t think it would’ve mattered, but it just wouldn’t happen. You know, it probably would have mattered 'cause people still would've been- Just because this culture of giving people a hard time, and I think- I don’t think it would have been because they’re gay, but just because they’re different we can give them a hard time. It wasn't quite focused on- It was focused on anybody who’s different because it’s fun, and makes us laugh. Rather than thinking about it, "Yeah, it makes you laugh but it’s really horrible things to do to people," and we just didn’t see that.
Phil Bertenthal & Alenka Figa::  Just a couple other things. I used to play a lot of bridge. One of the people I used to play bridge with a lot was a classics professor by the name of John Crossett.
Phil Bertenthal & Alenka Figa::  He actually wound up marrying a woman from our class.
Phil Bertenthal & Alenka Figa::  And today, I mean, I'm-
Phil Bertenthal::  And he would challenge me, and you know, when I started looking at the question, "Who’s the professor or staff member who influenced you, most?" I realized that as I thought about it, I had thought it was my major stuff but it wasn’t- it was John Crossett, 'cause to argue with him is, I had to be really on my game. I had to know my fact, I had to know my stuff, I couldn’t be sloppy. And if you hang around with only people who think like you, you starting thinking sloppily, because everybody agrees with you and you don’t attack things critically. And John Crossett just forced me to- y'know, pushed me to the wall on my issues. Whatever it was we were talking about, doesn’t matter, politics, anything, he would always force me, and just tighten my mind up in a way that really helped me later on both in terms of all different things, including the practice of law which I wound up doing, because he was just so there.
Phil Bertenthal::  So that was- that was kind of interesting because you know, you think of Grinnell as this great progressive institution with this history of- all this history and to have my most influential professor be probably both a conservative person and a conservative, politically, person, being the person that influenced me the most I think says something about the school, and I think the school- It’s because the school respects scholarship and thought, and there was a lot, and John Crossett was just really, really good at that and a lot of people didn’t like him, because- But, I did. I mean, well, probably because I played bridge with him and he was my advisor, both. It was just coincidence both happened. And it was just- it was an interesting- an interesting time.
Phil Bertenthal & Alenka Figa::  My favorite place on campus was the Forum. The Forum was the center of everything. I mean, I really- It’s too bad that it is such a physically bad building. ‘Cause it does- I mean, all those little steps up and down. But I mean, if you’re on South Campus, you’re coming to class, you have to go through the forum. You’re on North Campus, you’re going to the library, you have to go there. Y'know, everything was here, because nothing happened on the other side. I don’t even know what the name of that street is.
Phil Bertenthal & Alenka Figa::  But, the only thing that happened north of Seventh for me is I would sleep and eat, ‘cause I ate at Cowles, y'know. 'Cause that was the other thing, men ate at Cowles and women ate at the Quad. So they- not only did you not live with women, men and women didn’t live together, they didn’t eat together. So, there was a lot- the integration of the campus really changed the socialization of the campus in terms of meals.
Phil Bertenthal::  Let me just- Other things that happened here too? One thing that.... How Grinnell has- Grinnell- a couple things have changed… First of all, the nice thing about Grinnell is, I think there’s something that’s consistent about all of us. About three years ago, I got an email from a woman who said, “I’ve recently graduated from Grinnell. I’m living in Chicago. I’m thinking of mov- relocating to LA. I’m interested in doing some progressive political work. I was wondering if I can meet you when I come out to see.” For some reason I just said, “Oh, yup! Come on in.” So she came by, and we talked, and we just got along really well. Turns out, she had done an internship at an organization in Chicago which I had been friendly with... the former director who’s there, emeritus… and we just had a bunch of different things in common, and she wound up moving to LA.
Phil Bertenthal::  My wife got her- put her in touch with an organization my wife was on the board of, and we became really good friends, and then another friend of hers from the class of 2008, and we- a woman from the class of 1973 who’s our Grinnell-in-LA person, and the four- and maybe one or two other people, we’d go out together and do planning events, and we just got along great, and there was something about our shared Grinnell experience from ’68 to 2008 that was really incredible.
Phil Bertenthal::  And one of my big goals is to kind of work on more of Grinnell being a life-long... That you, when you start at Grinnell, but after you graduate, not only do you have an ongoing obligation to the College and to the students, to the College, and even to the current students, but also that the College has an obligation to you in terms of both- in terms of y'know, teaching you and stuff, and so that you should be part of that community for the rest of your life.
Phil Bertenthal::  I think some of that is actually there, but I don’t think we really focus on it. That’s kind of like my big goal and stuff. Especially- and it just happened when I realized how much I liked these folks in the class of 2008. Then I started meeting other folks in 2008 because they’re all friends with each other, and I didn’t know- And so it was just interesting talking to them and, plus it was fun ‘cause I get to tell them the same stories that I told you right now and they think, they say, “Oh really?!” Y'know, it’s always fun to find out those things. So, I mean, if you’re enjoying it at all, you gotta- They enjoyed listening to me, whatever. So that was a really kind of cool thing about Grinnell, which is..
Phil Bertenthal & Alenka Figa::  And the oth- I mean, whenever I come back from reunion I always meet somebody from my class that I never talked to before.
Phil Bertenthal & Alenka Figa::  Because you just don't get to- You think you know everybody on campus and it’s small, but you really don’t, and we were more isolated then because I didn’t know men who didn’t live in North Younker very well.
Alenka Figa & Phil Bertenthal::  Can I ask- so, the way Student Government was structured- like, I know it didn't have as much influence as it did now, but it also sounds like it had a really different structure than it does today?
Phil Bertenthal & Alenka Figa::  There was a lot of smoking on campus. Cigarettes.
Phil Bertenthal::  But... And I don’t know how the structure- inside the women’s halls they had a different thing. In the men’s halls we had different people in charge of different things. The College didn’t provide anything in the halls, so, for example, I remember we had a big- One of the things was, we're raising money so we could buy a TV set, and North and South Younker decided, “Ah, we're gonna raise- we’ll buy- we'll divide up North lounge and…” There were two lounges at that time in the basement of Younkers. I don’t think that they’re there anymore. I think they put in computers, or something.
Phil Bertenthal::  But, we had the North Lounge- the North Younker, said “OK we’re gonna make North Younker Lounge into the TV, the tube room,” and we basically all chipped in and bought a color TV. And there was only like two or three color TVs on campus. And then in South, then we said “Okay, then we'll use the other room- people can study in there and they can watch TV here.” So we did that. We did hall parties. We organized parties. We used to take- charter a bus once a year and go to the Amanas for a hall dinner. So that's what- So that’s kind of what the government on the men’s campus was. I don’t know what the overall grouping did, but they were mainly- the house presidents were basically in charge of enforcing the rules, y'know?
Phil Bertenthal::  Y’know House Mother system most of the time I was there. All the women’s dorms and most of the men’s dorms had House Mothers, who lived in, kind of the suites, but I think they're where now the President’s suites, the House Mothers lived there. These were older, retired women who lived there and their job was to kind of look out for us, y'know, in the old, old way, and it was- Which didn’t really- They didn’t really do much of anything really, ‘cause there was not- and my last year they switched over to a system- They got rid of all the House Mothers and started adding Resident Advisors, and I don't know what they- and...
Phil Bertenthal & Alenka Figa::  But, so that was part of the Stud- Then the other part of Student Government was Student Government Association. Each hall elected two senators.
Phil Bertenthal & Alenka Figa::  Anf the other thing was just all the cool people that came to campus, you know? We had, Dwight Eisenhower came to campus, Martin Luther King Jr. Just, all kinds of senators. I mean, we had one weekend senior year, same week that Martin Luther King Jr. came in, like 25 or 30 leading Americans, artists, writers, commentators all came, so there was a lot of stuff there. There was a lot of things happening on campus that kind of kept you busy, so...
