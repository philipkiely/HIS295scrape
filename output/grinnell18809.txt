Margaret Bogie::  My name is Margaret Ann Bogie. I live in Chantilly, Virginia, and I'm class of 1976.
Erica Seltzer-Schultz::  Alright, why did you come to Grinnell?
Margaret Bogie::  I came to Grinnell for a- really a- accidentally. It was not a purpose of choice. I was in England between my junior and senior years of high school. I wanted to be a Medieval historian and English history was my passion. And my parents were smart enough to at least give me a contact. They didn’t just let me loose me on England, which was probably wise. And this lady, Peggy Wanamaker, was a 1960 Grinnell graduate and she was really cool.
Margaret Bogie & Erica Seltzer-Schultz::  And, so.. One of the things she said to me was: "You oughta look at Grinnell." I had never heard of Grinnell. I had no idea, but she was pretty cool. I thought, "Okay, I'll look at this." One of the things I wanted when I was 17 years old was I wanted to get far away from my parents as possible. High school was kind of boring.
Margaret Bogie::  My older sister for example, she went to the All Women’s Teacher's College. But, by the early 70s, that was changing, and one of the big attractions to me for Grinnell was it was co-ed. In there, you know, we were all mixed up together and there were even co-ed dorms, which was 'Wow'. This was exciting. And there were no requirements. At that point it was really pretty wide open. You had to take a freshman tutorial, and you could... You had to have some diversity in your classes, but not much 'cause this child did not want to take any math. I really was not interested in science. I wanted to study medieval history. I was bound and determined, and as my advisor will tell you:
Margaret Bogie & Erica Seltzer-Schultz::  I was probably one of the narrowest History majors they'd ever produced. I just didn’t- I didn't wanna go past 1600 and I didn’t for a lot-
Erica Seltzer-Schultz & Margaret Bogie::  It's interesting 'cause my mom is from Alexandria, Virginia. She's the class of '81, and is still like- Yeah, going to Iowa was really kind of going far.
Erica Seltzer-Schultz & Margaret Bogie::  What was your- Do you remember your first memory of campus?
Margaret Bogie::  It was just like, really bizzare. So, you got there at the Des Moines Airport and, you- ran into a couple of other Grinnellians from my class: Charlie Becker, Maura Porper from Houston- who's here for the reunion, which is good. And, we took a little- We took a taxi cab over to the bus station and we rode the bus into Grinnell. And there was a Conoco station. It's not there anymore. It's gone, but it was on the corner of 6th and... what is it, 6th and..? Again, on the road to the high- I can't even think about where it was. Well, anyways, it was in the corner of then town, and we just got dropped off at the bus station.
Margaret Bogie & Erica Seltzer-Schultz::  There we were, and there were a bunch of students to meet us. I remember Rameen Armajani. He was a couple of years ahead of us, "Armo", was- had a big trolley, and just threw our bags, stuff on it, and we went wheeling down the sidewalk, you know, just to campus. And, kinda threw us in the dorm and then we went to a party and everyone was smoking marijuana and drinking, and it was just like, 'Woo-hoo!', you know? It was pretty memorable. I was just like 18 years old and going 'Wow, this is a wild place.'
Erica Seltzer-Schultz & Margaret Bogie::  Wow, that's really interesting. Was there- I think I know, where it's like- Was there a professor, student or staff member who had a particularly strong influence on your life?
Margaret Bogie & Erica Seltzer-Schultz::  He's picky. He is so picky, and he’s right but he's picky. And, you know-
Margaret Bogie & Erica Seltzer-Schultz::  I was stubborn, and, of course, my great friend is my advisor, Phil Kintner, who is the kindest man. One of the kindest people. What I like ab- why I love Grinnell so much is that I have known him since I was 18 years old and still I- You know, it still feels weird calling him 'Phil'. That- it's strange, but yesterday when I was out here for Alumni College, I ran away a little bit and went to see him and, you know, it's 'cause-
Margaret Bogie::  It's a sustaining relationship. I will not come to this town and not see him. And.. He’s 84 now, and he’s doing well. And we talked about hist- we were talking about Machiavelli, and.. We were just busy chatting about stuff. It's fun. I mean, it's like going home in a lot of ways. You know, to an intellectual, emotional home. Those relationships are invaluable. While- Other people go to colleges and maybe they have 'em, but I think here at Grinnell you do, because I have other classmates, who have the same type of relationships with different professors. There’s a real, great humanism and a caring for the students that lasts much longer after you graduate. It's truly an amazing, amazing thing.
Erica Seltzer-Schultz & Margaret Bogie::  That's really... This is kind of a broad question but: what would you say your best memory is, of your time at Grinnell is?
Erica Seltzer-Schultz & Margaret Bogie::  Okay, wow, that’s really interesting. What kind of- This is kind of a little-er one, but what kind of clothes did you wear every day when you were at Grinnell, or on special occasions?
Margaret Bogie & Erica Seltzer-Schultz::  Yeah. It pretty much here- Well, like in Grinnell one of the first things you'd do is you'd ditch your purse. You didn't... And there is a very strong peer pressure on how you dress. You just... You didn’t wear makeup.
Erica Seltzer-Schultz & Margaret Bogie::  And was that a pretty unique- was that pretty unique to Grinnell?
Margaret Bogie & Erica Seltzer-Schultz::  I’m not sure where the washing machines are now, but I lived on South Campus. And so they were all in Loose basement. I don't know if that's still- I mean, I don’t know if the washing machines have been-
Margaret Bogie::  But anyway.. So, I live, like, in Cleveland and James. So, I would wait 'til about... 'til I ran out of underwear. So you just didn’t have any. So I had this like, kind of velvety-like dress- I didn't have to wear underwear under it, so... You put that on, and you waited 'til like two in the morning 'cause you didn’t really want anyone to see you in this, and, like, running with my little bags of laundry. My pillow cases stuffed with laundry, and doing laundry in the middle of the night in this dress, and running- [Laughing] It's like you'd think- I was so ridiculous. So ridiculous!
Margaret Bogie & Erica Seltzer-Schultz::  But.. you know, you had little costumes. Sometimes we would get dressed up. I think, toward the- I guess they had the- The Waltz had come in on my junior year, when I wasn’t here. So, we got to kind of dress up a little bit for that, but it wasn’t something you did. You- It's basically pretty proletarian. I can remember for my graduation, I refused to wear a cap and gown because it was, to me, I never... Why would I do that?
Margaret Bogie & Erica Seltzer-Schultz::  I wore a sundress because we were sitting down in Central Campus. I got a a heck of a sunburn, but I just wore a sundress, because I said, 'This is.. I never dress this way. I'm not gonna wear that.' So..
Erica Seltzer-Schultz & Margaret Bogie::  Let's see.. Describe your favorite place on campus.
Erica Seltzer-Schultz & Margaret Bogie::  If you knew what you know now, what would you have done differently during your time in Grinnell, if anything at all?
Erica Seltzer-Schultz & Margaret Bogie::  What did you end up doing?
Margaret Bogie & Erica Seltzer-Schultz::  And there's a lot of interesting ideas out there. So, I probab- I mean, I wouldn’t mind coming back. If I had the money to spend on getting a second BA, it would be kind of fun to do this. I mean, not do Medieval History, 'cause I can do that fine, but do something else. So it kind of comes back and bites you after a long period of time.
Erica Seltzer-Schultz & Margaret Bogie::  So, how would you compare the students of your class with the students of today?
Margaret Bogie & Erica Seltzer-Schultz::  You know. I just finished listening to a faculty presentation Alumni College about this climate change class. It was, y'know, Wayne Moyer was teaching with someone from the chemistry department. Elaine Markoff? And it just.. The projects and the papers and the way that they really... the teaching... And I'm thinking, 'This is really interesting,' and the output from the students was very impressive.
Erica Seltzer-Schultz & Margaret Bogie::  So, kind of on that angle... Describe student life. What would you and your friends do in your free time?
Margaret Bogie::  We drank, and had parties, and kind of played hard, and sat there. I mean, sometimes we were smokin' dope and talkin' about politics or whatever. During the time I was here was also when Watergate was happening. And that was interesting because- I can remember when the Pub was down by Gardener Lounge, we would go down and drink beer and watch Walter Cronkite, every night, like religion.
Margaret Bogie & Erica Seltzer-Schultz::  And when Nixon was giving these various speeches, I remember the speech with all the notebooks of the tapes. So we were all in North Lounge at the Forum, and, I mean these professors were there. I remember Don Smith being there. In so- we were actually in the South Lounge, and it was full and we were watching the stuff on TV, and it was like... Well, the reaction, everybody's like shouting at the TV, and 'YAAAAH!' y'know? It was crazy.
Erica Seltzer-Schultz & Margaret Bogie::  It was amazing being here at the 2008 election, which was unbelievable.
Erica Seltzer-Schultz & Margaret Bogie::  So.. That's really interesting. Do you have any other kind of things you want to share, or..?
Margaret Bogie & Erica Seltzer-Schultz::  Post-Grinnell was good, too. That- I think it was really cool on campus, but even afterwards, it doesn't end. It just doesn't end, because it's like this network, and I’m sure you will run into this, other alums, who- especially if you're married to a non-Grinnell spouse- they'll say like, "What is it? Do you people send out Z-waves and attract each other?" 'Cause, you know, you can walk down a street, you know, I could- have your little Grinnell thing on, people will stop you.
Margaret Bogie & Erica Seltzer-Schultz::  I can give ya an example. I was.... A couple of years ago- I own a horse farm out in... kind of in between Warrington and Culpepper, Virginia, and I take horse boarders. So these people who'd moved down from Buffalo brought their, you know, bringing their horse and they came out, just to- to see the farm and make sure it was ok for their horse to be there. Lovely people and really chatty, and I said, "Well, you know, when your horse arrives, I'm not gonna be here. Somebody else will be here, because I have to go to Iowa." And they go, "Oh.. like Iowa... What about Iowa?" I said, "Oh, I’m going to, like, my Grinnell reunion, planning," and they just cracked up. Class of '59. Class of '60. Right? It was so funny.
Margaret Bogie & Erica Seltzer-Schultz::  And my husband, of course, was standing there, going, "How do you people find each other?" I’m still very good friends with them. I mean, their horse is moved closer to their house, which is fine. But she is fascinating. She is just a really cool person. I keep in touch with both of them, and, you know, that's what I like about it. There are so- There's-
Margaret Bogie::  My first reunion here I met people who were at Grinnell-in-China. I mean like, in the 1930's. They did wild things too. We always think, you know, we're the wild ones, as every class does. They paid some classmate, to destroy the depression, I guess. They got like a quarter each or something to run naked around the old women’s gym, and had gotten in filmed. I'm not sure how they did this, but they showed it at their reunion. It was like- yeah. Yeah, it was wild. I mean, I don't know- I did not see it myself, but you know, you can see the sprit never dies. It's just there and it comes out in different ways. So, I think the important thing about Grinnell is, yeah, it's here, but it continues on 'cause it's not about the buildings; it's about the people. It's always about the people.
