Ann Stillman::  Okay. So I say: This is Ann Stillman.
Chelsie Salvatera & Ann Stillman::  Yes.
Chelsie Salvatera & Ann Stillman::  Class year?
Ann Stillman & Chelsie Salvatera::  What is my first memory? Ohh.. I don’t think I have very many first memories. I do... I lived in Main Hall..
Chelsie Salvatera & Ann Stillman::  Okay. Great, okay. So, was there a professor, student, or staff member who had a particularly strong influence on your life?
Chelsie Salvatera & Ann Stillman::  What are your best memories of your time at Grinnell College?
Chelsie Salvatera & Ann Stillman::  So what are your best memories of your time at Grinnell?
Chelsie Salvatera & Ann Stillman::  What did your dorm look like? Or where did you live?
Chelsie Salvatera & Ann Stillman::  Did you- Didn’t you- Did you live in Read, as well?
Chelsie Salvatera & Ann Stillman::  Okay, so what did you do as president of Cleveland? What does that have to...
Ann Stillman & Chelsie Salvatera::  Anyway, the women chose and each one was the president of one of the dormitories and it was called the League Board. That’s kind of like the women’s self-governing.
Chelsie Salvatera & Ann Stillman::  Okay. So what was your specific duties as the- or-
Chelsie Salvatera & Ann Stillman::  But it wasn’t like a strict role, like...?
Chelsie Salvatera & Ann Stillman::  Wow. What kind of clothes did you wear every day as a Grinnell student? On special occasions?
Chelsie Salvatera & Ann Stillman::  It was mostly skirts and what-not?
Chelsie Salvatera & Ann Stillman::  Was there a book in college that influenced you the most?
Chelsie Salvatera & Ann Stillman::  So you were a Biology major? What did you end up doing with that?
Chelsie Salvatera & Ann Stillman::  What memories or images do you have of the town of Grinnell?
Chelsie Salvatera & Ann Stillman::  Bowl-o-drome?
Chelsie Salvatera & Ann Stillman::  Okay. How has Grinnell changed since you were a student?
Ann Stillman & Chelsie Salvatera::  And, oh, yes, things were more divided into departments.
Chelsie Salvatera & Ann Stillman::  Describe something that is no longer available on campus but that was meaningful to you. Old buildings, programs...
Ann Stillman & Chelsie Salvatera::  But, there might’ve been a way, like in more recent times more old buildings have been rehabbed.
Chelsie Salvatera & Ann Stillman::  Okay. Describe your favorite academic experience or class at Grinnell.
Ann Stillman & Chelsie Salvatera::  Yes, that was a very special class to me and I think that’s the reason, because he was very- encouraged us to explore classes with government. Civil Service, like to go to Washington and see what might be available, and that’s what I did actually, is I went to Washington and got a job in the Smithsonian in the Natural History Museum, and that was a wonderful experience. So, I think that class was, that was the kind of thing that I was really interested in, but there weren’t very many things like that.
Ann Stillman & Chelsie Salvatera::  And there was another class which I didn’t take. There was an International Relations Club.
Chelsie Salvatera & Ann Stillman::  Okay. Describe your favorite place on campus.
Chelsie Salvatera & Ann Stillman::  You wanna talk a little bit about it?
Chelsie Salvatera & Ann Stillman::  I didn’t know about it until you guys came and you guys, the people, the alumni, pointed it out to me.
Ann Stillman & Chelsie Salvatera::  I keep thinking I should find out. I think it’s a lovely memorial and I think many people must treasure it because I always find little offerings there.
Chelsie Salvatera & Ann Stillman::  OK, if you knew then what you know now -
Chelsie Salvatera & Ann Stillman::  Okay. Oh. This is one for you. If you met your spouse at Grinnell, describe how you met and fell in love. I think you're the only one that I have that married a Grinnellian.
Ann Stillman & Chelsie Salvatera::  And... a kind of a funny story.
Ann Stillman & Chelsie Salvatera::  So we sneaked him in and we dressed him up in a flannel nightgown, and then we’d invite people one at a time to come down to the room to see that he was there, like it was a big joke, right? Well, when the Dean of Women found out about it later, she didn’t think it was funny, right?
Ann Stillman & Chelsie Salvatera::  Yes, and my husband-to-be, in Anatomy class, saved his cat skull for me ‘cause we were studying. I had to get ready for an exam and he saved a cat skull for me so that I could study and get ready for the exam, I think- A sign of true love, right?
Chelsie Salvatera & Ann Stillman::  How would compare students of today with your classmates?
Ann Stillman::  Maybe we were- we felt more limited, more, and limited to the campus, like people didn’t go away to study. That was kind of unusual. We were just here on the campus. And we weren’t allowed to have cars, so we never went anywhere. We really had to try to be a community, or be in the community that was here, and that was a full time job.
Chelsie Salvatera & Ann Stillman::  Okay. Describe student and campus life as you experienced it during your time at Grinnell.
Chelsie Salvatera & Ann Stillman::  Wanna talk a little bit about that?
Chelsie Salvatera & Ann Stillman::  Were you a cheer- Was there cheerleaders?
Chelsie Salvatera & Ann Stillman::  Last question: If you were writing a history of Grinnell College, what would you include from your years here?
Ann Stillman & Chelsie Salvatera::  It’s interesting talking to people now, y'know, like about the swimming pool for instance and comparing with the swimming pool we had.
Chelsie Salvatera & Ann Stillman::  I mean, one more question that I have of my own. So, were there are any like personal struggles as a woman coming to Grinnell, and just like, the segregation of the males and the females, was there any particular struggle that you had being female on campus?
Ann Stillman::  And it seemed- and because right after the war there was a big emphasis on when the veterans came back, they were interested in getting married and having a family, even though many women maybe had been quite independent during the war and worked outside the home. But then it all shifted back after the war, and everyone in my class I think practically, almost all the women married immediately after graduation, and if they worked at all it was because they had gotten an education certification so that they would be able to teach school. Very few women in my class actually went off independently and had their own career.
Ann Stillman & Chelsie Salvatera::  One of the few was Francis Nakamura, from Hawaii. Oh, yes! Who went to medical school.
Ann Stillman::  Yeah. And- and that was really unusual ‘cause Francis knew all along what she was gonna do and she seriously pursued her studies and she did it. But, I didn’t seem to have that sense about my life. But anyway, everybody got married but I didn’t get married and it was, I went to Washington and got the job at the museum.
Ann Stillman::  Then, in the summer of ’52, my college- my roommate, who was just graduating then, she and I made a bicycle trip in Europe, a youth hostel trip, and we went from like, about July and we came back in November. We stayed in youth hostels, and so we had this wonderful experience and we- we were so excited. We felt it was the first time we were really learning something. You know, we were on our own and we were curious about everything.
Ann Stillman::  So, it was almost like that was the moment when our education began, because here we didn’t have- we weren’t married. We didn’t have obligations and we were choosing what we were doing, and we were learning all of the time. We especially were interested in museums, cathedrals, architecture, and we were in England, France, Switzerland and Holland. And, it was like I was setting off on my own for the first time.
Ann Stillman & Chelsie Salvatera::  And then my lab partner came to visit me, actually in Washing – when I was working in Washington.
Chelsie Salvatera & Ann Stillman::  Okay. Where did you go to grad school?
Chelsie Salvatera & Ann Stillman::  I'm glad you got to travel a lot.
