Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  Want me to start?
Willa Collins & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  'Kay.
Willa Collins & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  Oh, ready?
Willa Collins & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  Mhm.
Willa Collins & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  Okay...
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  (Whispered: Say who you are.)
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  I'm Ellen Liebman, class of 1979.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  And I'm Ann Lion, class of '78.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  And... when I-- When we were on campus-- I actually came to Grinnell because my brother was here, and I was very close with my brother, and my parents felt it would be a nice, safe thing to have me under my brother's care. And it was in the 70's, and, being a woman, I was much less able to be out on my own than my male brother.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  And there was a really cool vibe on campus at that time. Everybody was just honest, and nobody locked the-- their dorms, the Loggia was never locked, people's rooms were never locked, cars were never locked, and there was a sense of pride that we all had confidence that nobody would ever lose anything. And I don't remember one theft during my time on campus.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  And being in this-- that safe of an environment at that young time of life was a really great way to grow, because it-- It just-- it was a safe foundation that you-- you could just rise from.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Yeah.
Ann Lion::  And I remember that safety being really important to me as well. I remember riding a bike, and just leaving it at McNally's, and, you know, coming back a day later and getting it.
Ann Lion::  And I remember going to McNally's without any money or a checkbook, and I remember the cashier saying, "Well, here, just take a counter check. You can-- You have a bank account here?" "Yes" Clerk: "Just fill it out for what you need."
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  That's right, I remember when they had those counter checks! Where anybody could just grab something and write a check.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Yeah. It was very safe. It felt.. it felt so nourishing, too.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  But it was also a very intellectual place, and it was a place to be with really, really smart people and think about tough things, and form opinions... And it helped me feel better about myself, feeling like I was a peer with other smart people.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  This morning we were talking... in sort of beginning to get ready, thinking about this session, and we were talking about teachers that were really... that had pushed us intellectually, and I was remembering Beth Noble.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  Ruh!
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  In this building.
Ann Lion::  And I would have nightmares about how hard she was and how I was not meeting her expectations, and I-- but I stuck with it. I was one of four Spanish majors that year. We all had worked very, very hard to make her pleased with us.
Ann Lion::  And by the fourth year, I finally understood what it was she was trying to get me to do, and I was telling Ellen and Ron earlier today that, of all the skills that I learned at Grinnell, this-- the ability to be analytical and ask questions, I got from Beth Noble.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  Y'know, I also think we had resources here that weren't available a lot of other places. My brother was big into science and he was really impressed that there was an electron microscope, and there was only, I think, five in the country at that time, and that was really impressive.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  And we also had a chance to have hands-on experience running a radio show! And that was a great learning experience too, having a regular show and coming up with programming week after week, and all that kinda thing.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  So--
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  And also, the sorts of people we were with. I mean, you-- Ellen and I have been life-long friends because of Grinnell. And I can't imagine life without you.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Me neither. Me neither.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  You know, we were also talking yesterday about how gorgeous the trees are on campus, and it feels like the same campus. I left because all the same trees are there, and we were really admiring how well people take care of the trees. And they really must know a lot in order to be able to, you know, groom them and make them so beautiful year after year.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  But, you know, after you leave a secluded place like this and this little bubble, and there's all this big thinking and and all this safety and all this intellect, and then you go out in the real world and to the chaos, and... you know, it stays and experience in your heart because you'll never have something like that again.
Ann Lion::  So, both of us have children now, and it's, as we go through this life outside of the bubble, the Grinnell experience is indelably tattooed on my soul, and...
Ann Lion::  My kids don't get it, my friends who aren't from here don't get it. They think it's odd. When I announced last week that I'm going to my 35th reunion, like, "Why would you do that?" It's like, why wouldn't I? This is a-- I've been lookin' forward to it.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  In fact, let me tell the honest truth here: I gave up a meeting with Obama yesterday to be here.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  Yeah. That blew me away.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  That's how much I love--
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  I woulda met Obama myself. Personally, I would've.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Her future son-in-law is.. has worked in the White House for five years, and he's leaving. And after you've been in the White House for a couple of years or whatever, if you have a good record, then Obama has like, a good-bye meeting with you, and she got to go! But didn't..
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Except I didn't. I came here because that's how important Grinnell is to me.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  So, anything else you wanna say?
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Hmm.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion & Willa Collins::  We were the era where women didn't shave their legs or their armpits.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion & Willa Collins::  Hahah!
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion & Willa Collins::  And that's what our school was known for. No--
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion & Willa Collins::  I know people who don't now, so..
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion & Willa Collins::  Really?
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion & Willa Collins::  Really?
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion & Willa Collins::  Yeah.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion & Willa Collins::  Yeah.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion & Willa Collins::  Hm, good.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Well, and then--
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  It's Grinnell.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  But after our time, the 80's hit, and it was more like what they call the "Me Generation" and all these freshman were coming in all dressed in dresses and things, and.. Yeah, we took pride in being low maintenance women.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Yeah. and anti-establishment women.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  I was just looking at these questions: my favorite spot on campus was South Lounge up in the top area. You remember that?
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  Yep, in the Forum. The Forum building.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  What did we call the little space up-- you know, we'd go through there--
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  Oh, they-- that building had so many little cubbies, and, you know, nooks and crannies that you could hang out in and... yeah.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  Mhm. Yeah, and so when they sh-- when they shifted over the Forum it was a.. it was a heartbreaker.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  Yeah, it was.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  Yeah.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  I lived through Darby's loss, but the Forum... that little favorite nook was a place for peace.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  Yeah, there's a question here about 'what buildings do you wish didn't change?'
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  Oh, really?
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  I wish that one didn't change, yeah. Yeah.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  So we had-- Anna and I had a Friday night coffee house, where we would do a bake sale, and then we would find a musician, some kid, somebody on campus, who would play that night fo tips. And so we did it like, every Friday, and we got it as a sanctioned program through the school so they would like, pay for our ingredients, and then we would...
Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  And so... So, of course Ann, being in the public sector --I guess that's what you call it, right?-- wanted it all to be non-profit, and I, being more of a business person, wanted, of course, it should be for profit! And so we had this long-going argument that finally lead to a falling out after college, beca--
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  I went in the business world, and she went to the-- to save....
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Calling health--
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Y'know, save everybody in the world. And I didn't see her for years and years, and then I started having dreams about her, and she was in my dreams like, night after night after night. And then I finally called her back, and we've been together ever since.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  But that coffee house was fun.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Heheh, yeah, and I think I didn't understand what non-profit meant. I thought it meant that you couldn't make any money, not that you could pull out profits back in.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Right.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Now that I live in the non-profit world, I realize how it really works.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Right, right.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Right, but the whole idea for you to take a penny for this, all this work you put in--
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Of course not. No.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Yeah.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  And our dorm rooms: we-- I remember we had to make our dorm rooms ours, even though we weren't allowed to. Remember that?
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  Uh-huh.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  And I... I remember I snuck in a gallon of paint and painted the walls. You remember that?
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  Yeah! I do!
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  That was Loose... Loose, second floor on Loose.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  Uh-huh.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  Painted it all blue and then I got that beige paint at the end of the year and painted it back!
Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  Ann also used to have an "Intensive Care" ward for plants, and everybody who had dead plants would bring her like, these sticks, you know? And she would keep it for three, four months or whatever, and hand back this lush plant. And she had an unbelievable touch! And she hangs up these boards, and all her intensive care unit was like-- [Laughter]
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Oh! Do you remember though when the boards and-- with the bricks?
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  I do, yeah. Of course, that was the year we did our bookshelves.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Right.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Yeah.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Yeah.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Yeah...
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  So I was lookin' at this question about clothing. I think we all wore hip-hugger bell-bottom jeans. You wore courds a lot.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  Did I wear courds a lot?
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  Yeah, you wore courds a lot. And we had Mexican shirts.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  Right. You're ma-- we wore all the Mexican-imported shirts, yeah.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  Mexican-imported shirts. Yeah.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  The white ones.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  Yeah.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  Yeah.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  I don't really remember--
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  And hoop earrings!
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Right, big hoo-- yeah. And some things never change.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  I know.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  One of these reunions I came to, somebody said, "You changed your hair! You moved the part!" [Laughter]
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  Ahh...
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Yep. I wish my brother was here this weekend..
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Sorry, Curt.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  It would be fun to be with him.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion & Willa Collins::  Alright, anything else you wanna say?
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion & Willa Collins::  ....No. I think they captured it.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion & Willa Collins::  I'll bet this thing's gonna be really coll when it's done.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion & Willa Collins::  Yeah, I-- I've heard a lot of cool stories already about what Grinnell used to be.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion & Willa Collins::  Uh-huh.
Willa Collins & Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Hm. That about where you wanna leave it?
Willa Collins & Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  I guess, well, one last thing I wanna say is, I feel really lucky.
Willa Collins & Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Yeah.
Willa Collins & Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  To have gotten in here, and been able to go here --especially at the era that I was in. You know, we had only tenure professors, and we had one-on-one conversations, open doors all-- it wasn't just ho-- you know, office hours, you could see your professors anytime, and they actually wanted to hang out and talk to you about intellectual subjects.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  And, you know, it was none of this, you know, cattle prodding to get a huge number of students through in a short period of time. It was all about the personal attention and the richness of the indiviual's experience. And I think they really went out of their way to make sure that everybody got what they needed out of school.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Yeah. No, I agree with her.
Ann Lion & Willa Collins & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  I remember all those tutorials --I don't know if they still do tutorials...
Ann Lion & Willa Collins & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  They do.
Ann Lion & Willa Collins & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  They do?
Ann Lion & Willa Collins & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  Mhm.
Ann Lion & Willa Collins & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  --would be at their professors' homes.
Ann Lion & Willa Collins & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  Right.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  Do they still do a progressive dinner? In the spring where the professors all have like.... you go to a different professor's house for like, appetizers, and--
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  No.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  Oh.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  It sounds nice.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  That was fun. That was really fun.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins & Ann Lion::  I think it was a fundraiser. I think you signed up for it, and..
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins & Ann Lion::  Oh.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins & Ann Lion::  Yeah, we had to pay.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins & Ann Lion::  Yeah, you had to pay, but it was all a fundraiser.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins & Ann Lion::  Yeah.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins & Ann Lion::  And... yeah. And students, for one night, went to one for appetizer and another for salad and main dish, and... It was fun.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins & Ann Lion::  Mhm.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  I remember Saturday steak night. Remember it?
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  Oh! Heheheh, and little-- your little leather piece of steak everybody got on Saturday night.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  And I remember going... the-- North Campus had better steak 'cause of the athletes.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  Oh, really?
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  Yeah.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  So we figured that out after a while, and we'd go--
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  Grass is always greener. That's true that they're identical steaks!
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  Jocks needed more protein than we did.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  Do you guys use the Main Dining Hall still in....? Is the Cowles Dining Hall still there?
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  No, the Cowles Dining Hall isn't there. In Main we call it the Quad.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  Yeah, we call it the Quad. Okay.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  Okay. We don't use it for just regular dining hall purposes, but there'll be events held in there officially.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  Uh-huh.
Willa Collins & Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Like, we had Spring Waltz in there.
Willa Collins & Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Oh, that's great.
Willa Collins & Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Yeah. Winter Waltz is usually there.
Willa Collins & Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Uh-huh.
Willa Collins & Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Yeah, see, those are things that've changed. We would have a toga party.
Willa Collins & Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Yeah.
Willa Collins & Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Right, we wouldn't-- we wouldn't have a Waltz.
Willa Collins & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  Well, there was a toga party in Loose first.
Willa Collins & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  Oh, there was?
Willa Collins & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  A couple months ago, so..
Willa Collins & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  And do you guys still do the Loose Hall Ball?
Willa Collins & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  I haven't heard of it.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  The Loose-- Okay, the Loose Hall Ball would be... what-- you had to come dressed as your most secret fantasy. And I came as a pregnant bride. [Laughter]
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  Which was, like, totally taboo, you know? To be a woman at Grinnell and say you were here to get married was like, not-- You know?
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  Right.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  But, yeah, that was great. That was crazy, and it was in... in was in the Loose lounge.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Yup. Yep.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  That was every spring.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  I also remember kicking the... the screens out every spring.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  And sittin' on the roof?
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  Sittin' on the roof.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  Do you guys do that?
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  Oh, yeah.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  That's the best.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  Yeah, yeah.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  In fact, we've done that a couple reunions and it feels really good.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  So I gotta tell you somethin' really stupid, two really stupid things.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  Yeah.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  First of all, when I got here, I kept pulling my white card out to go touch the thing.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  Right.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  And some kid said, "Now, you know, all you have to do is that." (Mimes waving bag in front of sensor.)
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  Oh, yeah.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  And I thought--
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  The sensors are strong enough that it's a really common sight to see people just waving their bags around in the general vicinty. [Laughter]
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  I'm-- it's a disappointment if you have to actually reach in your bag to grab your wallet.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  Really?
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  Oh, yeah.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  I didn't even know the technology existed.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  Oh, yeah.
Willa Collins & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  And people, you know, if they have somewhere on their person, you'll see people who have their card in their shirt pocket, just making little, strange gestures at the sensors. [Laughter]
Willa Collins & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  That's funny!
Willa Collins & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  Yeah.
Willa Collins & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  That's really funny..
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  And then the other-- The second--
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  Oh, and the other thing was, I read in the thing that the Loggia was being replaced with... something you called the Forum, or forum, and it's supposed to have all these features in it.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  Right, right.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  Okay. Well...
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  And she tells me:
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  I thought they're demolishing the Loggia--
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  We were above there.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  And they're gonna build some monstrosity that has all these kiosks in it. [Laughter]
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  We were both really unhappy.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  And so, then we saw the sign that said, "Come see the new Loggia."
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  "Oh, no!"
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  And there's a screen, and we said, "Well, let's see it! I wanna see what this thing looks like!" And the guy said, "Have you heard about it?" I said, "Yeah, I'm scared to death of it." And he's goin': "Well, just like here! It's right there!" and, "You just have to enter here." And it's like, "Wait a minute..." [Laughter]
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins & Ann Lion::  Yeah, so my references are antiquated.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins & Ann Lion::  Well, I mean, no one's happy about the.. you know, East Campus Loggia, the way that they built those, but...
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins & Ann Lion::  Really? Y'know.. they built that after we left--
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins & Ann Lion::  Right.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins & Ann Lion::  --and I've never been in those buildings or looked at those buildings.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins & Ann Lion::  Well, you should go check it out.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins & Ann Lion::  We ignore them.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins & Ann Lion::  Are they--
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins & Ann Lion::  Well, we ignore them too, but..
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins & Ann Lion::  Are they nice?
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins & Ann Lion::  They're too nice.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins & Ann Lion::  See?
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins & Ann Lion::  Oh, they're-- they're so nice, they're not Grinnell.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins & Ann Lion::  Yeah, see? That's what we were just talking about.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins & Ann Lion::  Mhm.
Willa Collins & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  Yep, yep!
Willa Collins & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  I live on South Campus.
Willa Collins & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  But East Campus is very new and very shiny, and people are afraid to mess it up, or, you know, there's not really much that happend there.
Willa Collins & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  Really?
Willa Collins & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  Yeah. It's very quiet and insular, but..
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins & Ann Lion::  So, is it the-- is it the least--
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins & Ann Lion::  And then the loggias are just useless, you know? They don't protect you from anything.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins & Ann Lion::  That Loggia?
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins & Ann Lion::  The East one.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins & Ann Lion::  Yeah, there are snow drifts in the Loggia in the winter. [Laughter]
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins & Ann Lion::  Yeah, there's no point.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  Are there bathrooms in each room? Or is it still a hall bathroom?
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  No. It's still a hall bathroom, so..
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  Oh.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  Oh, that's another thing, that is-- was from our era. Our co-- our era was new for being co-ed dorms.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  Right.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  Oh, really? Co-ed everything?
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  And co-ed bathrooms.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  Yup.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins::  We had co-ed bathrooms for the first time, and that wa--
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins & Ann Lion::  It was no big deal to me because I had brothers...
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins & Ann Lion::  Right.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins & Ann Lion::  But... we talked to a couple of people who have gotten-- Ron Cowen, who came and did his-- grew up with brothers, and he said the first time he saw a girl in the stall, it's like, he couldn't go to the bathroom for weeks!
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Willa Collins & Ann Lion::  Yeah, he said he couldn't make a sound. [Laughter]
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Yeah.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  But, going-- and when we would go back to our, you know, places of, you know, our homes and talk about our co-ed dorms, people were always flipped out.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Right, that's right. Yeah, 'cause that was weird.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Yeah.
Willa Collins & Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Were your dorms fully co-ed? Like, each floor was--
Willa Collins & Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Was mixed.
Willa Collins & Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Okay.
Willa Collins & Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Yeah, girl--
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion & Willa Collins::  And-- and, I think all the dorms were that-- There was one dorm that was men, Langan, and then one that was women, which is-- what's the one next to Langan on the other side of the tower?
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion & Willa Collins::  I think it was Read.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion & Willa Collins::  Clark?
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion & Willa Collins::  Clark? Okay. Clark, I think, was the girls' dorm. Other than that, every floor was mixed.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion & Willa Collins::  Mhm.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion & Willa Collins::  So--
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion & Willa Collins::  And we didn't have any single-sex dorms on our campus, on South Campus.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion & Willa Collins::  Right, but Vasser didn't do single-sex floors, you know? It's like my-- my kids had: there's a boys' floor and then a girls' floor and a boys' floor and a girls' floor.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion & Willa Collins::  Mhm.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion & Willa Collins::  And I've seen that, and they call that co-ed dorms, but we had co-ed life, you know?
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion & Willa Collins::  Hm.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion & Willa Collins::  Right.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion & Willa Collins::  I mean, we lived like brothers and sisters.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion & Willa Collins::  Mhm, mhm. Yeah, there was a very-- little romance on the floor.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion & Willa Collins::  No.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion & Willa Collins::  Right.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion & Willa Collins::  --Amongst our--
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion & Willa Collins::  But we had great food fights. [Laughter]
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  And water fights!
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  (Gasps)
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  We had a water fight one time!
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Let me-- this is a memory. This is a classic Grinnell memory.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  You were part of it, where I was-- Lucy Rosendahl..
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  Yeah?
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  --started it.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  Yeah?
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  You were part of it. You all-- we had one empty room. It was off in Cleveland, third floor-- and everybody had decided to trick me for a semester. And... Lucy invented this person called Bunny Rodriguez.
Ann Lion & Ellen Liebman Glatstein::  I remember Bunny Rodriguez!
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  She was never in her room!
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  She was never in her room! And I would say, "I haven't-- I haven't met her yet." And, "Oh, she just left to the Library." You guys were all in cahoots the whole semester. And I--
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  I remember Bunny Rodriguez!
Ann Lion::  And they'd like, leave little notes on her wall, or on her door, and I lived exactly in front of her, so, you know.. I don't know why I was so gullible, but it took me the whole semester 'til you finally told me that you'd all made her up! [Laughter]
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  That was pretty funny.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Thanks!
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  It was pretty funny! Ohh..
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  I would believe everything you say.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion::  Yep.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion & Willa Collins::  Okay, are you done?
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion & Willa Collins::  Yeah, I guess.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion & Willa Collins::  Okay. I think I'm done, too.
Ellen Liebman Glatstein & Ann Lion & Willa Collins::  Alright.
