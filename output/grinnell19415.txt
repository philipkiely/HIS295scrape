Alenka Figa::  Go ahead.
Amy Fort & Alenka Figa::  My name is Amy Fort, I currently live in Galesburg, Illinois, and I am the class of 1993, Grinnell College.
Amy Fort::  Yeah. I actually came to Grinnell because my uncle attended here in 1951. He didn’t push it on me but I came and visited, and I was recruited to play basketball here. So, I came for a visit and my parents asked me if I wanted to come here and I kinda shrugged my shoulders and said, “I don’t care.” And I ended up coming, so.
Amy Fort::  But, my first.. You know, when I came to Grinnell I lived in Gates Hall and I had a quad. I lived with four roommates. One was from South Africa, one was from Chicago, and then South Carolina. So, a mixture of different people, but the person who I roomed with who is most memorable to me is Tammy Zywicki, who... We were very good friends first year and she was a lot of fun. And she ended up not making it to graduation, so that was very sad, of course, and that’s probably the memory that sticks with me the most through my Grinnell experience. So, that was a very difficult situation but certainly one that has stuck with me forever.
Amy Fort & Alenka Figa::  So, I played sports here, and I think my most memorable experience was not as much academic as it was winning the conference championship in 1991.
Amy Fort & Alenka Figa::  But I did- y’know classroom-wise, Victoria Brown, who’s retiring this year, was one of my most memorable professors and I actually shared a moment with her this weekend which was very humorous to me. Because she.. My, as you know probably, when you graduate from here you need to take a senior seminar and you have to get – well, at least we used to back then, back in the day.
Amy Fort::  So my second one my senior year I took was actually Russian History and Dan Kaiser taught the class my junior year, and I decided I wanted to do Russian History for my senior seminar because I was so interested in it. Well, Dan went on sabbatical and so this very young professor came in who just got her PhD and she really was very tough, and we had one paper due for the whole term and you have to get a C or better, and it was coming down to crunch time and I was struggling. She was just very... you know, just very difficult. So I was sharing this story with Victoria Brown and saying I almost didn’t graduate because I had this paper in my final grade. She gave me a C and she wrote a note and said, “This is a gift.”
Amy Fort::  So I was sharing this story with Victoria Brown yesterday and she remembered the professor in her youth and actually responded to me that this person was unreasonable. And that- and so I just looked at her, I was like, “Oh my God, I’ve waited twenty years to get through that.” So, yeah. So, it helped me feel much better about that class ‘cause y’know, things like that hang with you for a while, so... But..
Amy Fort & Alenka Figa::  No- I’ve got a, kind of a love-hate relationship with Grinnell.
Amy Fort::  I left here with a degree in History and I think the love-hate probably comes from the tragic situation that happened with my roommate. Y'know, when we were seniors, she was abducted and murdered and we looked for her. We had a big campus gathering. We tried to find her and it was just very... a very awful way to start our senior year, so. Yeah, and it’s funny, you know, being back for Alumni Weekend, ‘cause none of us really talk in depth about it but you know that it’s impacted all of us in some way, so... But, I think the best thing that came from that is that the community of Grinnell was, we really pulled together as classmates and as professors. We were all on board with each other. But... I think that’s where the love-hate comes in.
Amy Fort & Alenka Figa::  But, the love comes in again ‘cause my daughter just graduated from here, and, I've- Y'know, she graduated two weeks ago and it was like, the proudest moment. It was even better than winning the conference championship. It was like, seeing my daughter onstage, so.. I’m very proud of her, so.. But that’s all I wanted to say. I don’t think I have anything else, here.
