Bob Richburg::  My name is Bob Richburg, Robert W. Richburg. I live in Ft. Collins, Colorado. My class was the class of 1961.
Chelsie Salvatera::  OK! Thanks for coming, Bob. First question: why did you come to Grinnell College, and what is your first memory of the campus?
Bob Richburg::  Well, this gets into my story a little bit. I came to Grinnell, really, because it accepted me. I did not have a sterling high school record and my first experience was, that I had, was assigned to an advisor who looked at my transcripts from high school. I went to a large high school in suburban Chicago. It was like, over 5,000 students and I had really been lost in the largeness of it.
Bob Richburg & Chelsie Salvatera::  But, my advisor looked at my high school transcripts and he said, Bob, he said, we’re gonna plan a nice, easy, 13 credits for you, easiest courses that we can find for you and you’re gonna flunk out and you’re going to have been able to tell people that you went to college for one semester. So that was my first experience.
Chelsie Salvatera & Bob Richburg::  Awesome. Okay, was there a professor, student or staff member who had a particularly strong influence in your life?
Chelsie Salvatera & Bob Richburg::  OK. What are your best memories of your time at Grinnell College?
Chelsie Salvatera & Bob Richburg::  What did your dorm room look like? I think you guys had the same dorm room for four years.
Chelsie Salvatera & Bob Richburg::  What kind of clothes did you wear every day as a Grinnell student, or on special occasions?
Chelsie Salvatera & Bob Richburg::  What book influenced you most in college, if you can recall?
Chelsie Salvatera & Bob Richburg::  What memories or images do you have of the town of Grinnell?
Chelsie Salvatera & Bob Richburg::  How has Grinnell changed since you were a student?
Chelsie Salvatera & Bob Richburg::  Describe something that is no longer available on campus but that was meaningful to you. Buildings, programs, activities...
Chelsie Salvatera & Bob Richburg::  Describe your favorite academic experience or class at Grinnell College.
Chelsie Salvatera & Bob Richburg::  Describe your favorite place on campus.
Bob Richburg & Chelsie Salvatera::  But the dorm was very important to me. We had a wonderful dorm experience. I was telling some people at lunch today, we were, prepping was a big thing, then. When you’re a freshman the upperclassmen wanted to initiate you into the College and into the dorm and the traditions of the dorm and my responsibility was, to my senior, was to catch mice and I had to catch a mouse every day or I got paddled that night. I had to, not just catch it, but I had to keep a chart with the length of the mouse and the length of the tail, the quality of its coat, how much it weighed, what I had caught it on.
Bob Richburg & Chelsie Salvatera::  This went on for, maybe, two months in the fall of our freshman year. But we had so much fun because we, they would do, the seniors would do things like that to humiliate us and then we would do things to turn around and show them that we were not gonna be humiliated. So, we, one of the times we got 100 pound blocks of ice and we stacked them up in front of the, the fellow who was in charge of this initiation program, his door. And he couldn’t get out of his door. Another time we put him on a train at 5 o’clock in the morning to Des Moines, just in his pajamas and his robe. No money, we didn’t give him any money and he got off the train, I think he got off in Newton but he had no way to get back. So we had a good time.
Chelsie Salvatera & Bob Richburg::  That is fun. If you knew then what you know now, what you have done differently during your time at Grinnell College?
Chelsie Salvatera & Bob Richburg::  If you met your spouse or partner at Grinnell?
Chelsie Salvatera & Bob Richburg::  How would you compare the students of today with your classmates?
Chelsie Salvatera & Bob Richburg::  Thank you. Describe student and campus life as you experienced it during your time at Grinnell.
Chelsie Salvatera & Bob Richburg::  OK. Last question, and then we can go to the story. If you were writing a history of Grinnell College, what would you include from your years here?
Bob Richburg::  Just the fact that it was a turnaround experience for me, and that’s my story. It was a situation where, for whatever reason, I was not a serious student when I came here. Today you can’t do that. You can’t come in to Grinnell if you have not been a serious student but I was not, and the fact that it was, kind of grabbed me and turned me around and got me going in a different direction. I never had any realization that I could be a capable student. That was completely a discovery for me, at Grinnell.
Chelsie Salvatera & Bob Richburg::  So was it the influence of students, teachers, staff?
Chelsie Salvatera & Bob Richburg::  Awesome. Do you have any other things?
