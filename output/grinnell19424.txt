Jim Asplund::  Oh, yeah hi! My name is Jim Asplund and I currently live in Woodbury, Minnesota, and I’m a member of the Grinnell College class of 1988.
Andrew Hopson::  Hi, I am Andrew Hopson, I live in Indianapolis, Indiana and I am a member of the class of 1986.
Sophie Haas & Andrew Hopson & Jim Asplund::  Okay.
Andrew Hopson & Jim Asplund::  While we were here we were in bands, uh, "Shopping with Mom", "Spankfestous", "Free Beer"...
Jim Asplund & Sophie Haas & Andrew Hopson::  Yeah, there was a lot of cross-pollination between the bands. There would be-
Jim Asplund & Andrew Hopson::  I remember we played outside once, a big prospective student weekend. And one of the guys in the band we were in was pretty odd. He was a great great guy but he was just- he was very theatrical. I remember, just remember this picture of the parents, staring at him wondering, “Is this what happens to my…?” We were, I think we were actually pretty good, so that’s why they were watching but then they'd- this guy could somehow do things, move around in ways that didn’t make any sense, y'know, vis a vis, y'know, gravity. But, nonetheless, y’know, and he was talking to them too, so I always thought that was kind of funny. But yeah, we played outdoors right over by that tree. Remember I had-
Andrew Hopson & Jim Asplund & Sophie Haas::  I think back then we used to always practice in Norris Pit. There was a- Norris had a basement and there was a band practice room down, I think we would pay ten dollars a semester for the privilege of using that.
Andrew Hopson & Sophie Haas::  And then, interestingly enough, I actually turned it into a career, which is kind of cool. I was a History major actually.
Sophie Haas & Andrew Hopson & Jim Asplund::  Yeah, they don’t let people get minors anymore.
Sophie Haas & Andrew Hopson::  And what is it that you do now?
Andrew Hopson & Jim Asplund::  Anything else we could tell about the music scene of the day?
Jim Asplund & Andrew Hopson & Sophie Haas::  I was trying to think of the band, was it "The Ornate Coalmen"?
Jim Asplund & Sophie Haas & Andrew Hopson::  So at fir- y'know, we obviously like playing music. I still play music too although I’m not a professional. And... But y’know we made a lot of good friends, and that’s a lot of the people we're hanging around here at reunion and have talked to over the years, and it was a great way to... kinda become immersed in the society, if you will, right away.
Andrew Hopson & Sophie Haas::  Yeah, for me it was a little different because I got here, I wasn’t musical. I wasn’t involved in music at all when I first started at Grinnell, and a friend of mine said, “I’m starting a band and I need a bass player. Do you wanna be it?” Like.... "All right." And when I first started here I was- I played on the football team for a couple of years and I blew my knee out, and so it was- music suddenly became this thing to fill all that time and re-devote my energies into that and, y'know, thankfully, I actually do have a career that I don’t have to worry about a, you know, career-ending injury anymore. “Ah, my ear! My ear!”
Sophie Haas & Jim Asplund::  And what was your major?
Jim Asplund::  Someone told me, before I came here, to just do what you like doing and that seemed to work really well, at least for me. So, classes that I fell asleep in, I didn’t take any more of those, and classes that I showed up for all the time, and did well in, I figure I’ll keep doing that, you know? So it’s a primitive system but it seemed to work and... so that’s what happened then.
Jim Asplund & Sophie Haas::  And y’know, it’s been interesting, and you have to think about it, you know, just, with my son, the son who’s going to college next year, and just kind of having to rethink that process, it’s been interesting to kind of- Because of course, you're- giving a 17-year-old advice is a fairly hopeless exercise anyway, but, you kind of wanna do it and see if it works out and I think he’s well set up for school now, but... So it has been interesting to think about how that all happened.
Sophie Haas & Andrew Hopson::  Is there any advice you guys would give to young musicians on campus? Anything that you wish you’d done differently, or…?
Andrew Hopson::  But on the same token, there’s never, ever, ever a sense that I have made it, I have now officially made it. Because there’s always somebody who’s doing better than you. There’s always somebody who’s got something better going on. So, it’s pointless to compare yourself to anybody else, and it just, y'know, figure out what your own metric of success is and then follow that.
Andrew Hopson & Sophie Haas & Jim Asplund::  And then other thing too, not to be long-winded-
Andrew Hopson & Jim Asplund::  Well, Julie.
Jim Asplund & Andrew Hopson::  But the thing is, he’s good at learning things so he would get good very quickly and work that.
Jim Asplund & Andrew Hopson::  I play the drums, so it’s good exercise for me, since it’s hard to get- but also, you know, it’s a good think time. It’s good relaxation time. It’s a good thing to do around your kids. It’s just a good- it makes for a good hobby especially if you wanna be around other people and do some nice things. So, if you keep up it’s- it’s been pretty rewarding in that sense, too.
Jim Asplund::  Professional musicians, professional actors are some of the most disciplined, hard-working people that you will ever meet. Y'know, people are, “Why would I want a Theater degree? Why would I want a Music degree?” Because, you may not end up working as a professional musician or professional actor, but you are going to have a work ethic that blows everybody else out of the water and that alone will take you far.
Sophie Haas & Andrew Hopson & Jim Asplund::  Great, thanks so much! Do you guys have anything else you wanna add, or...?
