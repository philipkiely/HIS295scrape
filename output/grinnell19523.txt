Kathryn Vincent::  Alright, so we're gonna have you speak into the mic here.
Charles Hawtrey & Kathryn Vincent::  Alright. Can you hear me okay?
Kathryn Vincent & Charles Hawtrey::  Can you say--?
Kathryn Vincent & Charles Hawtrey::  So, why did you come to Grinnell College?
Kathryn Vincent & Charles Hawtrey::  What was your first memory of Grinnell?
Kathryn Vincent & Charles Hawtrey::  Did you swim all four years?
Kathryn Vincent & Charles Hawtrey::  Was there a professor, or a student or staff member who had a particularly strong influence on your life while you were at Grinnell?
Kathryn Vincent & Charles Hawtrey::  Are you a doctor now?
Kathryn Vincent & Charles Hawtrey::  So you teach at the medical school there?
Kathryn Vincent & Charles Hawtrey::  And you were a biology major here?
Kathryn Vincent & Charles Hawtrey::  What are your best memories of your time at Grinnell College?
Charles Hawtrey & Kathryn Vincent::  And... there were other people who were-- Ken Christiansen was a great friend and he was the advisor for Cowles Hall, where I lived.
Kathryn Vincent & Charles Hawtrey::  And there was a cook, whose name was Gus, and I'm blanking on his last name, but Gus would invite all the waiters and waitresses to his house and we would dance the Shodershen and have this wonderful time with traditional German food.
Charles Hawtrey & Kathryn Vincent::  Let’s see, what else do I want to say? Well, I didn’t tell you the story of her. So, Anne’s sister, Betsy, class of ’59, came to Grinnell in her sophomore year.
Charles Hawtrey::  And there was the tradition at the time that, if you were out on a date, you said goodbye to your date at 10:30 precisely because they close the doors, and this mass of men went down the Loggia, down to Loose Hall, and just exploded out onto the campus at 10:30 at night. And my swimming buddies were betting on when I would first kiss Betsy goodnight.
Charles Hawtrey & Kathryn Vincent::  And, at the time, you knoe, guys didn’t want to offend a girl under any circumstances. You were always polite and did your- appropriate things opening the door and blah, blah, blah.
Charles Hawtrey::  And then of course, Grinnell had other traditions of quasi-engagement. If you gave your beloved one your Honor G pin, that was big and significant, and you serenaded her outside her room. And she was in Mears, and so you sang, “Honey, honey, bless your heart.” It was.. you had a bunch of your friends assisting you in this process, and I had friends who were good singers, and so we had a tenor and a baritone and a bass and it made for great music.
Kathryn Vincent & Charles Hawtrey::  Very cool. So that was a tradition then?
Charles Hawtrey & Kathryn Vincent::  And there’s another one that I think is just unforgiveable, but it’s not our choice.
Charles Hawtrey & Kathryn Vincent::  But the year that I was- the year before I was co-captain, when we won the championship, it was our third year, and so my brother, John and I made replicas of the duck to honor the event...
Kathryn Vincent & Charles Hawtrey::  What was your dorm room like?
Charles Hawtrey & Kathryn Vincent::  And it was- You felt like you were in a monastery, and that was what you had. The bathroom was in the middle of the space, and you shared it with all your buddies on the floor, and that was back when there was a segregated campus.
Kathryn Vincent & Charles Hawtrey::  So what was your- where was your favorite place to study?
Kathryn Vincent & Charles Hawtrey::  What kind of clothes did you wear every day as a Grinnell student?
Charles Hawtrey & Kathryn Vincent::  Well, and so... she insisted that I know how to iron my trousers and my shirts, and could run the folding through the Laundromat over on men’s campus. So I did that, but we also had little laundry boxes, which you could mail home--
Kathryn Vincent & Charles Hawtrey::  So were there any special occasions you would dress up for? Did you have to wear a tuxedo or a suit or anything?
Charles Hawtrey::  The women’s campus was very- reasonably formal. Young women wore white blouses, dark skirts and they sat by house at tables assigned there. And I kinda liked- I loved my job working in the women’s dining room, because you got to see all the girls first thing in the morning before they did their makeup and stuff. So you knew who the attractive young ladies were.
Kathryn Vincent & Charles Hawtrey::  Was there a book that influenced you heavily while you were here?
Charles Hawtrey & Kathryn Vincent::  I guess the thing I appreciated most about Dean Norton was- he was one of the history professors- was that he always gave you a good book, which you could save and reuse the information in the books, so.. He taught British History and I have a hanker--
Charles Hawtrey & Kathryn Vincent::  Go ahead, ask more questions.
Charles Hawtrey & Kathryn Vincent::  And so- so this one day, I went into the operating room and all of my surgeon buddies were laughing up a storm, “Hawtrey, you went to Grinnell?” And I said, “Yeah…”
Charles Hawtrey::  So, yeah. I think that things have changed. I think that Grinnell has been remarkably flexible and adapting to the society in which all of us live, and I think that’s valuable, and also, they’ve kept their goals of concerns for the poor and the disadvantaged, and I’m glad that that sort of... philosophy continues. I am always proud of my Alma Mater.
Kathryn Vincent & Charles Hawtrey::  So when you heard about the Playboy incident, were you proud to say, “Yes! I went to Grinnell!” Or...?
Kathryn Vincent & Charles Hawtrey::  I have heard that the Cowles dorm was the non-conformist dorm though, from some other Alums in your cluster.
Charles Hawtrey & Kathryn Vincent::  I learned at Grinnell to sleep with a pillow around my ears. I disciplined myself and it paid off in medical school.
Kathryn Vincent & Charles Hawtrey::  It worked. Sounds like it worked well.
Kathryn Vincent & Charles Hawtrey::  Do you have a favorite academic experience or class that you remember from Grinnell?
Kathryn Vincent & Charles Hawtrey::  Describe your favorite places on campus while you were here. You talked about the science building...
Kathryn Vincent & Charles Hawtrey::  Where was the pool when you were here?
Kathryn Vincent & Charles Hawtrey::  Was it on the East side of the railroad tracks or the West?
Charles Hawtrey & Kathryn Vincent::  ..And if you read my book about Erve Simone--
Kathryn Vincent & Charles Hawtrey::  If you knew then what you know now, what would you have done differently during your time at Grinnell College?
Charles Hawtrey & Kathryn Vincent::  I have to go to the Honor G Dinner.
