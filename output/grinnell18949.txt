Rebecca Mauldin::  Rebecca Mauldin, Chicago, Illinois, class of ’05.
Chelsie Salvatera::  OK. Thank you, Rebecca. So, first question, like always, why did you come to Grinnell College and what is your first memory of the campus?
Rebecca Mauldin::  It was kind of, it was by chance, actually. My mother read about it in a book, and she was like, “You should go check out this school. It sounds really interesting.” Then I came and visited and there was something about the College that just, I couldn’t put my finger on it but that felt natural. There are so many like, places here to study that I was like, “I wanna study in all these places. I could go here.”
Rebecca Mauldin::  My first memory is walking on South Campus with my father, and I lived in Loose and chalked on the sidewalk said, “Loose girls are loose,” and my father gave me this look like, “I might take you back home. Maybe we’re not staying here.” But then I also remember him driving away and me feeling like, “OK, this is it. I’m here. There’s no turning back at this point. I’m here.” But it was one of those moments where you grew up a little bit.
Chelsie Salvatera::  Yeah, awesome. So during your time at Grinnell was there a professor, student or staff member who had a particularly strong influence on you?
Rebecca Mauldin::  Yeah, it’s hard to pinpoint just one because I was a Theater major, and that whole department, they were just, y’know, fountains of like, knowledge. So, they were all really important to me but I remember particularly my senior year Pip Gordon, who doesn’t work here any longer, she was just amazing. The way – and this goes for all the teachers – but the way they really care about their students. But she- I was like, “I’m lost, I don’t know what I’m doing,” and she was like, “Well, here’s what I know.” She, I took like three pages of notes because she just was spewing information and it was, y'know, the teachers just really care about their students and it was really lovely to feel that way.
Chelsie Salvatera & Rebecca Mauldin::  Yes, the connection, right. So, this is kind of broad but your best memories at Grinnell College?
Rebecca Mauldin::  I remember the first play that I was cast in. It was Leslie Delmenico’s, who I think is the chair of the department now, and just that whole process of being part of a group, making a show, that was really exciting for me. So, it was a great memory. And then, oh, also feeling like someone was like, “You are good enough to be in my show. I want to work with you,” that was very exciting. And then, just those great moments where you like, get your... the curriculum? The first day of class, I loved that ‘cause you read through all of it and you were like, you realized that all of this stuff on the paper that you didn’t know was going to be in your brain. You were going to learn it all, and I loved that first day and buying your books and just the potential that this new semester holds for you. So that’s very exciting for me. I’m a nerd.
Chelsie Salvatera & Rebecca Mauldin::  No, but you were talking about theater a lot and all of that, so I just wanted to know how Grinnell, your major, or just like any of the academic experience influenced your career?
Chelsie Salvatera & Rebecca Mauldin::  I like that answer. So, what did your dorm room look like?
Chelsie Salvatera::  That was in Loose?
Rebecca Mauldin::  That was in Loose. And then after that I was an SA in Norris and I remember the day that we did room draw and I had a really terrible number, and I cried when I got Norris. To me now that seems absurd, like 'Why did I cry? That’s so silly.' But it’s so far away-
Chelsie Salvatera::  It is.
Rebecca Mauldin::  I was like, “Oh, my God, I’m gonna have to walk so far,” and now I live in Chicago and I’m like, 'that’s not far at all.' This campus, it’s all about where you live and then you sort of have a different idea what the scale is. But, I loved being an SA, that was super fun. I mean, all the dorms here, you make them your own. Yeah, it’s so weird to be back. It feels like, concurrently weird and very natural. Like, naturally I would live in this dorm, ‘cause I’m staying in Haines right now; that’s where I lived my senior year. It feels very strangely natural just to be back.
Chelsie Salvatera & Rebecca Mauldin::  What kind of clothes did you wear? I mean, you weren’t here that long ago, but what kind of clothes did you wear every day and on special occasions?
Rebecca Mauldin::  It was always really fun getting ready for Waltz though, ‘cause then you saw everyone burst out their, or bust out their prom dresses. That was very exciting, get very pretty and you go dancing and, yeah, so I think that was the time that I like, really dressed up. But I have this great, this is silly but my friend saw someone rollerblading across the way and she was rollerblading in a skirt and she was like, “I knew that was you ‘cause you’re a big weirdo. You would totally rollerblade in a skirt.” I was like, “Fair.”
Chelsie Salvatera & Rebecca Mauldin::  Was there a particular book that influenced you most in college, if you recall..?
Chelsie Salvatera & Rebecca Mauldin::  How do you feel, in terms of Grinnell now and Grinnell then, I guess, changes since you were a student?
Rebecca Mauldin & Chelsie Salvatera::  Yeah. JRC. I actually really love it and I’m sort of, I love this sort of Gothic architecture and, I don’t even know if it’s really Gothic but I love this old- I’m a big fan of old architecture so I was like, “No! I don’t like anything nice, I don’t want new stuff! Keep Darby!” and I think this center is fantastic. The windows, it gets so much light, it’s nice to sort of not have that divide, those who eat at Cowles and those who eat at Quad. It just feels like there’s better unity now, I think. But, yeah, I think the campus has done a lot of great things to sort of promote unity and grow but still sort of keep the same Grinnell spirit in everything they do.
Chelsie Salvatera & Rebecca Mauldin::  Is there anything that’s no longer available on campus that was meaningful to you? Like buildings, programs, activities?
Chelsie Salvatera & Rebecca Mauldin::  Would you say that was your favorite place on campus, or do you have another favorite place on campus?
Chelsie Salvatera & Rebecca Mauldin::  If you knew then what you know now, would you change anything during your experience at Grinnell?
Rebecca Mauldin::  Like, I was very busy, ‘cause I was doing, my freshman, sophomore year and I did dance troupe and theater and classes and my teachers didn’t seem to understand that I couldn’t- their class wasn’t the only one I was taking. Which, simultaneously is difficult, ‘cause you have so much to study, and kind of awesome ‘cause they’re like, “I just wanna give you all of this knowledge and then you take it and you do what you will with it.” Yeah, so I wanna say, yes, but I’m not quite sure where it would’ve been different, might've been the same.
Chelsie Salvatera & Rebecca Mauldin::  That's a good answer. Did you meet your spouse or partner here at Grinnell?
Chelsie Salvatera & Rebecca Mauldin::  Just- very broad question. Describe student and campus life as you experienced it during your time at Grinnell. Srudent and campus...
Rebecca Mauldin & Chelsie Salvatera::  There are a lot of, this campus just felt like it was full of a lot of very eclectic, interesting people that cared about a lot of things. Sometimes I actually felt that was kind of overwhelming, like, what do I have to contribute? And then you find your niche. You find your place at Grinnell and you’re able to thrive. I was just...
Chelsie Salvatera & Rebecca Mauldin::  This was my first year, too.
Chelsie Salvatera & Rebecca Mauldin::  Do you feel like the students- or how do you compare the students now to your classmates?
Rebecca Mauldin::  I used to mourn birthdays because I’m getting older and that’s not very exciting and then my friend, who’s ten years older than I am and she’s very very wise, so brilliantly pointed out, “But don’t you like yourself so much more now? You’re smarter, you’re more interesting, you’ve done a lot more. More experiences.” I was like, that is a brilliant way to look at it. "I am, I do like myself a lot more now." But then you get older and, it just sort of happens. It's really lovely.
Chelsie Salvatera & Rebecca Mauldin::  One final question. If you were writing a history of Grinnell College, what would you include from your years here?
Rebecca Mauldin::  The sense of community in Grinnell College is really amazing. Being back here is just, it floods you with memories, like wonderful memories. I think that’s so essential to a college experience, that you come back and you are overwhelmed by this sort of sense of love. That’s cool, but that’s hard to write down, y’know? That’s not, that’s a feeling. So that’s not very specific, but that’s the best I got.
Chelsie Salvatera & Rebecca Mauldin::  Is there anything you wanna say, anything else additional? Things you wanna talk about?
Chelsie Salvatera & Rebecca Mauldin::  I'm glad you stayed on.
