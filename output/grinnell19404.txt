Julie Jones::  Okay, my name is Julie Jones Dresel. I currently live in Los Angeles, and I’m a member of the Grinnell College class of ’87.
Julie Jones::  I first heard about Grinnell from the PSAT test. They sent me information and I had never heard of it before but it intrigued me because it was in Iowa, and I was from outside of Seattle, originally. And I really wanted to know what four seasons were like, and I knew that Iowa had real winters and I had never experienced that, and real summers. And I loved the Laura Ingalls Wilder books growing up and I thought, you know, “Little House on the Prairie. That’s what I want to experience.”
Julie Jones::  So, I came to visit and it was in the dead of winter of 1982. And I just loved it. The hub of the campus was the Forum, there, and everybody was hanging out and there were people wearing Birkenstocks with no socks in the dead of winter and there was snow everywhere. And I thought, “This is the place for me, where I don’t have to worry so much about being popular and all the things that consumed me as a high school student. So, none of my family was from the Midwest. They had never heard of Grinnell. I just decided to come on my own, and it was an adventure. I really thought it was an adventure, so...
Julie Jones::  My first dorm room was in Younker Pit, and I remember feeling thankful because if there was a tornado I was already underground, and that was good, for me. And I had a really fun dorm, dorm mates. And I remember it was a little bit shocking because we had to vote on the bathrooms, whether they were gonna be co-ed or single-sex, and I was informed very early on that you weren’t cool if you voted for single-sex, okay. You had to be cool and say, “OK, I’ll share the stall. Y'know, the stall next to me might be a guy. I just have to get over it.” And we did, but you know, it was an adjustment. And we also got to vote on whether we wanted cats. You couldn’t have dogs, but you could have cats, so we had two cats in our dorm and that was fun.
Sophie Haas & Julie Jones::  So who took care of the cats?
Julie Jones::  And what else...? I did have a professor who had a strong influence on me, but it wasn’t until my junior year. I decided, finally, I was gonna be an English major, so I found Michael Cavanaugh and he really helped me through because I was, y'know, behind in my credits and wasn’t sure I had the aptitude. And my senior year he did call me in and said, “What are you gonna be? Where are you gonna go after your graduation?” and I said, “Well, I’ll probably be a waitress, and I have no plans.” So he said, “I thought you were gonna say that, so I really want you to think about graduate school.”
Julie Jones::  And I did end up going to graduate school. I didn’t finish, but I, to this day, feel really thankful that he had the confidence in me that I could do it if that’s what I wanted to do. And he did say, “I know you have the aptitude, but I’m not sure you have the personality for it.” And he was right. It wasn’t for me, but at least, y'know, he spurred me on in that direction.
Julie Jones::  Oh, there was kind of a dress code back then, in the 80s, and it was: nothing nice. It had to be thrift store chic. It had to be oversized and look like you had no money, you came from poverty. And if you carried a purse it was like death, you know? You did not carry a purse, or else you would be vilified and humiliated by the cool people so everybody just either carried a book bag or back pack, or, y'know, had their valuables or their Student ID card in their pocket or something. We got little wallets, Grinnell wallets, and we carried our keys and our cards in that, and money. But a purse was like, “Oooh. You must be conservative.”
Julie Jones::  The worst thing to be called in the early 80s was “conservative.” So most of us, a lot of us, coming to campus, might have put down that we were Republicans on this card that they gave us because our parents were Republicans. And very early on- you had to be very strong in your, y'know, self-esteem to continue along in the Republican vein. Very soon I said, “No, I’m liberal, really!” And I didn’t really have any idea what that meant because I didn’t pay attention until Grinnell. So that was a good education for me.
Julie Jones & Sophie Haas::  Let's see. Grinnell’s changed a lot, of course, in the buildings and student life. My daughters ask me how I ever got along without- with meeting up with people without having cell phones, and I think that most of my time at Grinnell was spent wandering around, looking for the party and looking for the people because nobody had a phone and there was just the phones in the dorm floors.
Julie Jones & Sophie Haas::  But, you could always be sure that there were people at the Forum, and there was people in the Pub. And the drinking age was 19. So, after your freshman year, you almost always were in the Pub.
Julie Jones & Sophie Haas::  But, y'know, the problem with the Pub is it did encourage a lot of drinking. There was too much drinking.
Sophie Haas & Julie Jones::  Do you feel like the presence of alcohol really shaped a lot of your experiences there, or do you think it would have been a less valuable experience had there not been as much alcohol?
Julie Jones & Sophie Haas::  On the other hand, you know, if you want to do something and, y'know, you don’t have the guts, sometimes you just needed a little bit of liquid confidence and you did do stuff that, you know, you think back on as something that, y'know, was a life-changing experience. Y’know, decide to take a road trip or- not drunk of course, but, you know, making the decisions to just be, you know, throw caution to the wind sometimes is good. But yeah, I do think, probably, there was way too much drug use and alcohol, which caused more heartache than good things.
Julie Jones & Sophie Haas::  What else? One of the reasons I chose the College is that it had no core curriculum, and I still think that it has no core curriculum.
Julie Jones & Sophie Haas::  My advice to students today is: “Just say no.” If you really don’t wanna take math, it’s gonna ruin your GPA and don’t take it because you don’t have to.
Julie Jones & Sophie Haas::  And I think- Oh, and the last thing I wanna say is, I did the Grinnell-in-London program, but my sophomore year.
Sophie Haas & Julie Jones::  Grinnell-in-Paris sounds wonderful.
Julie Jones & Sophie Haas::  I mean, kids nowadays don’t understand that these dorm rooms are big.
Julie Jones & Sophie Haas::  So my advice would be to stay in the dorms and get to know more people, ‘cause once you’re off-campus your social group shrinks.
