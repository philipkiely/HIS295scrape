Heather Riggs::  All right, go ahead.
Allison Foley::  Hi, I'm Allison Foley, class of '01 and originally from New Jersey, and then came here, and now I'm in Indiana and I don't know where I'm going come August. Somewhere. But, y'know... Go ahead.
Tyler Bradbury & Allison Foley & Heather Riggs::  I'm Tyler Bradbury, class of '01 from California and I'm back in California via China, France, New York state, Nevada.
Allison Foley & Tyler Bradbury::  And then we immediately went out and bought that plant.
Tyler Bradbury & Allison Foley::  Didn't I take him home with me senior year?
Heather Riggs & Tyler Bradbury::  Well, do you have anything specific that you came in wanting to talk about?
Tyler Bradbury & Heather Riggs::  What made me decide was, I, literally, I think I stepped onto campus and was like, "Yup, this is the one. Home." But the way I found it- My mom was our college counselor and she was really big on me going to a school that I liked and I knew I didn't want to go to a big school, and I was looking at Middlebury. She freaked out because it was all the way in Vermont instead of in California, and then we looked at a few schools in California and she kept saying things like, "Oh, I can come visit you on the weekend," and so I was like, 'Okay. Compromise.' And I ended up in Iowa.
Allison Foley::  Go figure. My mom and I used to watch Jeopardy all the time together, and we would battle, and I remember College Jeopardy, what, like 1994, '95, a Grinnell woman won and we were like, "We've never heard of this school," and immediately forgot about it until I started getting in the pamphlets and stuff. We were like, "Oh, that was that Grinnell lady. Oh, that was, oh, Jeopardy, yeah yeah yeah." And then I was like, "Oh, it's in Iowa? Mm." and I threw it all away. I threw all of it away. I was like, 'I'm not moving to Iowa; I'm from New Jersey, and nah nah nah.' And then they sent this letter out and it, I wanna know who in the admissions office decided to do this ‘cause it was brilliant for those of us who are socially awkward. Where they sent this and like- "Maybe you lost our first mailing, or maybe you're just so busy you didn't have a chance to respond, but we really wanted to hear back," and you know, I was like, (Gasps). I felt so guilt-ridden that I wrote back.
Tyler Bradbury & Allison Foley::  So basically Allison went to Grinnell from guilt.
Heather Riggs & Allison Foley & Tyler Bradbury::  Was there a professor, student or staff member that particularly influenced you?
Tyler Bradbury & Allison Foley::  I remember, I think it was the first or the second week of our freshman year, my parents will not let me forget this. I called them and I was like, "I don't belong here. Everyone has taken these things called AP classes, and I never had an AP class, and they all had such high SAT scores and I didn't have- I do not belong here! I don't belong here!'
Allison Foley::  You were like, "I just spent the last year in Europe," and I was like, "Oh, I- I worked at a deli." So yes, everyone was super interesting. Y'know, people were coming in from all over the place and had done all these neat things, so that was- that was really... That was- and yeah, everyone pushed each other to do something interesting. 'Cause you didn't wanna be the one schmuck that was like, "Whuh," navel-gazing the entire time.
Heather Riggs & Allison Foley & Tyler Bradbury::  What was student and campus life like when you were students?
Allison Foley & Tyler Bradbury::  And we had... Our class was abnormally large. It was a really large class, so they made doubles into triples so there were a lot of people up there but we bonded really fast and I remember the first, like, month we all moved as like a single unit. And yeah, we were- because we were so tight I think that first year we spent a lot of time like, making our own fun. I mean, neither of us were huge partiers when we first came, so... So, I remember we'd be, like, (Whispered: 'What is this?')
Allison Foley::  But yeah, I just remember- I mean.. ‘Cause you didn't- you're 18. You're just figuring it out and figuring out, you know, how to interact with people that's not in high school. So, the social scene was good ‘cause you could always talk to people and people would always just, like, sit at your dining table, and you'd meet new people. Like Vivek with his name game. Do you remember how Vivek met everybody? It was like, the first two days...
Allison Foley & Heather Riggs & Tyler Bradbury::  He would sit down– It- have you- I'm sure, maybe he's come in– but he's this like, tall, skinny Indian guy. He had just- it was his first time in the states and he would like, run up to every table, plop himself down and is like, "My name is Vivek. Vivek with a v. V is for victory. Bah blah blah, go." and you'd have to play the name game around. You're like, "OK!" and yeah, but then people would like pop up and introduce themselves, so, it started where, like yeah, you just started meeting people and you'd find somebody that you hadn't met before and then you'd go and meet their whole floor. And there was the parties and all sorts of things, but we were saying that things were much... I don't know, are they still segregated, sort of, by north/south? I guess there's East Campus now.
Allison Foley::  Yesterday, they were mingling and I was like, I was having fun talking to some of the people and I- we walked out today and I was like, "I really would like to go say hi to people, but I have like no place over there." I'm like, "I'm gonna be 32 in a couple weeks; that's ridiculous! I should be able to talk to whoever the hell I want!" (Whispered: "But I'm still awkward...")
Heather Riggs & Tyler Bradbury & Allison Foley::  How did this like, campus segregation impact social life?
Allison Foley & Tyler Bradbury::  And Bob's was very segregated and that was always a shame. That was, like...
Allison Foley & Tyler Bradbury::  So, I mean I think things are... Once we graduated though, people started, y'know, plans was such a huge deal. It was a big deal when we were here. Prior to it being any web-based email- We were talking today about the VAX system... Back in the day... and plans started as this...
Allison Foley & Tyler Bradbury::  You could chat on there. Like, 1997 we were IMing and then it became a big deal elsewhere, and we were like, "Oh, we;ve been doing that for ages." But because plans was so important, with the VAX, they- Rachel Heck started it up, in what, 2000? 2001 or something. She reconstructed it so that we could all keep in touch. I think that was a huge social shift. I mean, there's a reason there's 103 of us from our class here and 99.9 perceont of that is because of Plans, and we all keep in contact, and even if we didn't hang out we know, like I know people's kids' names even if I've never spoken to them.
Allison Foley & Heather Riggs::  So yeah, even people that I've never spoken to, I know what they're doing, I know where they are, and then you feel like a weirdo ‘cause you're like, "Hey how's that thing? And I… mean…"
Heather Riggs & Tyler Bradbury & Allison Foley::  How did Plans impact student life when you were here, and then as alumni?
Allison Foley & Tyler Bradbury::  And so you could be like, "So and so is here, so if I leave the Forum at this time I can run into them. But it was mostly like, y'know, these heartfelt like, what, y'know, U2 lyrics, and like "Why don't you love me?" that we thought were oblique and they totally weren't and you always knew what was happening with people.
Allison Foley & Heather Riggs::  It's an advice and sharing.. It's almost- it's very much a safe place and there was a while, I guess, last year where people were arguing over Plans and that got shut down fast, like, 'No, this is a safe place. People come here because there's nowhere else to go and this is where we support each other,' and it's the best community. I mean like, everybody's so supportive. In fact, somebody had an issue- a sort of relatively dangerous domestic issue. People banded together, collected money and set something up so that she could get out.
Allison Foley & Tyler Bradbury::  The, y'know, it's a good community and it's sort of strengthened by that, y'know, the community we had here and people still keep track of people they actually hung out with, but I've made friends that I wouldn't have met otherwise over it. In fact I just wish I knew your Plans' name. Oh, that's what it is, OK!" That's what-
Heather Riggs & Allison Foley & Tyler Bradbury::  What are your strongest or best memories of your time at Grinnell?
Tyler Bradbury & Heather Riggs & Allison Foley::  And so one morning she went up- she got up for an eight o'clock class and she left the room and, I was barely awake, just kind of aware that she was leaving the room and she must've been just waiting because the moment that door closed she bolts off the top bunk, runs across, strips the bed down, runs down and washes all the sheets and remakes the bed before our roommate got back.
Allison Foley & Tyler Bradbury::  Gosh, I have all sorts of ridiculous- I have so many ridiculous memories.
Allison Foley & Tyler Bradbury::  I remember people slipping and sliding on that little thing down on the side of the Forum, and people like, just skidding out.
Tyler Bradbury & Allison Foley::  Oh, I remember when they had to evacuate…
Heather Riggs & Tyler Bradbury & Allison Foley::  From cyanide poisoning, or-?
Allison Foley & Tyler Bradbury::  Remember we'd like, poke our heads out, sit in the hallway for ten minutes and then hide back?
Tyler Bradbury & Allison Foley::  Really? I don't remember this at all.
Allison Foley & Tyler Bradbury::  And, yeah, all sorts of ridiculous things. I remember, oh, everything, mostly. I remember skinny dippin' right before graduation.
Tyler Bradbury & Allison Foley::  You have such a better memory than I do.
Heather Riggs & Tyler Bradbury & Allison Foley::  How has Grinnell changed since you were students?
Allison Foley & Heather Riggs::  I don't, y'know, it's so weird ‘cause so it's so easy to so like, "Kid's today!" and to have that kind of- which is so strange 'cause we're not that old. But I remember like the whole- I mean is self-governance still a really big thing here?
Tyler Bradbury & Allison Foley::  Dining Hall's a big change.
Tyler Bradbury & Heather Riggs & Allison Foley::  There's no longer a little menu of what's being served every day?
Tyler Bradbury & Heather Riggs & Allison Foley::  So I don't remember that. But I didn't think that having one dining hall must make- ‘cause North and South Campus was, y'know North Campus ate at Cowles, South Campus ate at Quad, and yeah... There wasn't a lot of crossover.
Allison Foley::  We were looking at the '06, '05 cluster and were like, 'We feel like we should know them even though we don't, because they look like us.' And you guys look like us. It's been really funny like, "Oh, right. OK, just a little time difference, alright."
Heather Riggs & Tyler Bradbury::  How do you feel- like- self-governance impacted your lives while you were here?
Allison Foley & Tyler Bradbury::  And there, we were really conscious of it here. Remember when they changed the alcohol awareness stuff during orientation? ‘Cause when we came in they did that, like, 'How to Take Care of Drunk People' kind of shtick but then the insurance policies changed on campus, so when somebody was sick you had to call the ambulance, and if the ambulance got called there was a police report and it became this huge deal and like, it was a big town 'n gown conflict…
Allison Foley::  Right, but they weren't doing the sort of how-to-take-care-of-your-friends spiel anymore and I remember everybody got really up in arms because, us coming in was, "All right, well people are gonna do dumb stuff," ‘cause you're 18, 19, 20 years old and that just happens. "But, here's how to look out for each other, here's what to keep in mind." You didn't have that same cultural philosophy, but you also didn't have the same sort of like, you just let your friend go. When they changed that, y'know it was ingrained in you immediately. So we were very conscious of that sort of self-governance and we were like, "You're being super drunk. Let's carry you somewhere and make sure you're fine."
Tyler Bradbury & Allison Foley::  But also just, being able- on dorms floors. Like our floor, we had to vote for whether or not it was smoking, and we also got to vote on if it was co-ed or not, co-ed bathrooms you know, and those kinds of things it was just sort of like that- it kind of installed that idea of, y'know, you can choose but you need to be responsible about your choices and respect what the choice becomes, even if it's not exactly what you want.
Allison Foley & Tyler Bradbury::  I mean, obviously people had different, idiosyncratic sort of quirks, if they forget to clean stuff themself. But at the same time everyone was really like, "Ok we're gonna talk about it," if there was a problem we would just, "Dude, what are you doing? Don't do that. That's messed up." Or y'know, "Please pick your underpants up. They've been stuck to this spot. It's bothering me," and people would be like, "Oh yeah, ok cool," because there would be a back and forth. My sister is a college sophomore now and she has problems and I was like, "Well did she talk to-" Like, ah, they hate the girl next door, They're gonna go talk to the Dean about it ‘cause she's so loud. I was like, "Oh, well did they have conversations with her?" "Oh, I don't know." "Did they talk to the RA?" "Oh, I don't know." I was like, well there's a chain of command here.
Heather Riggs & Allison Foley & Tyler Bradbury::  How do you feel like your class was distinct from classes before or classes after you?
Allison Foley & Tyler Bradbury::  I mean, really. I think we're much more bonded as a class. I think part of that is plans, because people do stay in touch.
Heather Riggs & Tyler Bradbury & Allison Foley::  What transitions did you see during your time here?
Allison Foley & Tyler Bradbury::  There was a big... It was, again, because of the educational sort of cultural push in academia, that really 'Let's get us into the top ten,' that became a much more of a thing, and focusing on the endowment and focusing on the College as a business rather than as this sort of idealistic, "Oh we're here for learning and anarchy," and that became a lot less of a focus. That sort of, hyper-liberalism of, "Let's shake things up. Let's do these crazy things," and I would wager that the classes, the older classes here probably look at our classes as being a lot more conservative because we just didn't have that. Right? Like that sort of ideology of revolution, as much.
Tyler Bradbury & Allison Foley::  It was, I think, I don't remember enough about this but I remember there being a lot of stuff against- Like there seemed to be, I think, I know global development studies wasn't new at that point but I felt like it was becoming- it was... being more developed as things were going on? I think we were getting a little bit more focused on global, and there was a lot of y'know, the sweatshop movement was while we were here.
Tyler Bradbury & Allison Foley::  And… what else do I remember?
Heather Riggs & Tyler Bradbury & Allison Foley::  What was the atmosphere like after the election, or leading up to it?
Tyler Bradbury & Allison Foley::  What happened? What did people do afterwards?
Tyler Bradbury & Allison Foley::  I was abroad in France with a program from a much more conservative school, and they were all really happy. I was like, "Aaaaaah!"
Allison Foley & Tyler Bradbury::  What's normative here is very different elsewhere. A friend of ours was just talking and she had been on some sort of, like, was hanging out with some friends and she was like, "Let's just cuddle, and like lay down and cuddle." They were like, "That's really weird," she was like, "Really?" I was like, "Yes, nobody does that anymore ‘cause we did that in our crazy little like, 'Let's all socialize in bed.'" That's not normal.
Heather Riggs & Allison Foley & Tyler Bradbury::  What memories or images do you have of the town of Grinnell?
Tyler Bradbury & Allison Foley::  I remember going to the thrift store that was over…
Allison Foley & Tyler Bradbury::  Which one?
Tyler Bradbury & Allison Foley::  Oh and I remember driving… oh I guess that's Iowa City, but going there for Disco clothes.
Allison Foley::  I remember when McNally's started changing, ‘cause it used to be much more mom ‘n pop, but then it started getting a little bit more cosmopolitan, but I remember first movin' here in '97 and like, this is a snobby thing to say, but the Midwest was really different back then. It was a good ten years behind what was happening on the coasts and it was a much more like, middle America, kind of, 'These are the things that we eat here,' and things have become much more homogenized, sort of food-wise, across the country. So, but at the time like, you couldn't get all of this stuff at all and you'd be like, "But where's the things that I'm used to eating?" And it was all this really local- I mean, it was great ‘cause was all this sort of local, cultural stuff but I remember that changing. I remember the Pub before it was no more. What else did we do?
Tyler Bradbury & Allison Foley::  I remember one summer I house sat for someone I worked for. I worked in the Library. I house sat for one of those people and I was off in a community that I was never in.
Allison Foley & Tyler Bradbury::  Yeah, that was fun. I remember, we used to take all those walks out into the countryside, remember? And ride our bike, when we had bikes. Every so often we had a bike, and I don't know...
Heather Riggs & Tyler Bradbury & Allison Foley::  What are your favorite places in Grinnell, either on the campus or in town?
Tyler Bradbury & Allison Foley::  Quad.
Allison Foley & Tyler Bradbury::  We spent a lot of time in the Forum ‘cause that's where you would go to see and be seen, so... We would leave our-
Tyler Bradbury & Allison Foley::  See, that's funny. I was thinking, I would go to the Forum to read because I could focus more in there, on reading if there was noise around me. Then I go to the Library to really study, or ARH, the study carrels in ARH. And then, yeah, I remember a lot more homework than socializing.
Allison Foley & Tyler Bradbury::  I didn't do as much as I should've done, but I also didn't party as much as I should've done too, so I don't know what I did. I talked to everybody. A lot. That's pretty much what I did.
Tyler Bradbury & Allison Foley & Heather Riggs::  I remember, Brenda Weiler concerts and Morphine.
Allison Foley & Tyler Bradbury::  And it was pre-Fregie and the hip people knew and were like, "We should really go." I was dating this guy who knew everything about music, I thought. He was like, "We really have to go to this." We go and it's up at Harris and there's like 25 people. Thy're just like, people milling around like, "Mm OK." They were good but it was like, "Oh, all right." I remember afterwards people were getting real flirty with them, and it was hilarious. It was just like, "What is going on?" ‘Cause I didn't know that they were a big deal and I guess it was another year or two before they really hit it huge. But people knew about them and it was very much a like, "We're gonna go hook up with the Black Eyed Peas!" And so they did. (Whispered: And they got kicked out of the hotel.)
Heather Riggs & Tyler Bradbury::  What was the role of technology on campus?
Allison Foley & Tyler Bradbury::  I hadn't at all. In fact I knew about it because my high school boyfriend was like, computer guy and he was like, "I have this modem thing." I was like, "So it's like a phone call between computers? Explain more!"
Tyler Bradbury & Allison Foley::  It was really, like, if you think about what we use the computer for now, it was- The technology was writing papers, it was checking your email. I know that it got big when we could store our own files and retrieve them, and not have to carry around floppy disks. But, internet wasn't a big thing.
Tyler Bradbury & Allison Foley::  I remember hearing about Facebook, but it was just for another school and we were all like "oh."
Allison Foley & Tyler Bradbury::  And even then you could sort of look stuff up but you couldn't find journal articles online. That didn't exist yet. So, you could find things- there was that automated system in the library where you could type in a keyword and it would tell you what journals it mainly had and then you would check the card catalogue to see if the journals were there. And then you would spend, I remember spending days on the third floor of the Library going through and getting journals and looking through the index of those and just copying articles on the photo- spent hundreds of dollars on the stupid photocopier. It was completely different. If you needed to know something you had to go and look it up. Our brains changed since then, and that's tricky. We were just talking the other day too, two people had cell phones on campus.
Allison Foley::  I don't remember who the other person was- I know Trey Reis had one, and he was like, super hip guy, and I remember he was on the cell phone, in Quad once, and Robin Kimble was like, "Put your phone away you fucking snob!" and they were good friends, so it was OK. But it was like, cause we were like "Who the hell would you need to call? It's all on campus." We all knew each other's extensions and you'd just call and if you didn't see them and they weren't at home then you would just see them at the Forum. You never needed to know where somebody was at any given moment. So, yeah I remember that. And now, phones- glued to our phones. I mean I have mine now-
Tyler Bradbury & Heather Riggs::  I know, we're both have our cell phones, and everybody, everyone's got their iPhone, y'know?
Allison Foley & Tyler Bradbury::  I can't be bothered to walk a half a block see if he's lingering where I think he's lingering. But, so it was a totally different thing. I mean, the way our brains changed in just processing information, but also the way we've changed socially is. I mean it's enhanced it obviously but at the same time it's much more, "I need to see you this second," or, y'know. There's no element of surprise anymore. Our friend Gant, remember? I used to like- Gant and I would like think about each other.
Allison Foley & Tyler Bradbury::  We need to just play hide and seek in Burling again. But yeah, it was really different. But it just exploded all, after that, so, I- you guys had a totally different experience. I saw something on Burling like, something on Burling bathrooms and they were like, "Things I like about you," and one of ‘em was like, "Sweet text messages you sent." I was like, "I guess you would text each other like, ‘I like you." But instead we all just like, whispered to each other.
Heather Riggs & Allison Foley & Tyler Bradbury::  Did you have secrets on Plans?
Allison Foley & Heather Riggs & Tyler Bradbury::  Is that a big thing here?
Heather Riggs & Tyler Bradbury & Allison Foley::  What were your favorite academic experiences at Grinnell?
Heather Riggs & Tyler Bradbury & Allison Foley::  Who did you have? ‘Cause I'm also a French major.
Allison Foley & Tyler Bradbury::  I just remember you camped out on that couch in our room in French House, and you threw- oh, you knitted the thing for it- crocheted a thing for it. You didn't – well, we'll get back to that, what happened to that couch.
Allison Foley::  But no, I just remember you camped out with those little books. Anyway, the couch, we sold it when we moved out, like the day. We were just like, put it out on the curb or whatever we did, we sold it to somebody for a dollar. It was a big gray couch. I guess, we left like, got a moving van, drove home or did whatever. Drove back to New Jersey. That night the couch was burned somewhere on campus, but it was identified as my couch and so there was this like, apparently without me knowing anything about it, like an investigation was kind of launched and they were talking about, oh, you know, vandalism, and expelling me. Then someone was like, "She's in New Jersey. She didn't do it!" But I didn't find out until months later. I came back and everyone was like, "You came this close to getting kicked out of school." I was like, "What!"
Allison Foley::  But yeah, I had a lot of good, y'know I think about the sort of most fun... I was a Psych major, originally, and then I switched. I was Psych and Classics, and then, now I do Anthropology. I remember it being senior year and being in one of the Archeology classes, and John Whittaker would have these like, bags of stuff that they kind of excavated in the thirties. Not the thirties: that's crazy pants. But like, in the seventies, like late seventies bag of dirt that had never been sifted and so it was this class project, of like, 'OK they're gonna rummage through. We ended up pulling out, like, bits of human bone. That's what I do now, but that was the very first time I had ever experienced that and I was so like, "This is awesome!" I was so excited and that was like a real pivotal moment and that's why Paul bought me those books on dead people archeology and that's why I'm doing what I'm doing today. For better or for worse.
Allison Foley::  But, that was- The most useful thing that ever happened, ever, was in my first semester. I was taking some class on like, Gods and Mythology or something or other and I remember the first paper we had to do was a one page. Explain the role of the gods in the Iliad. One page. Terrible assignment. There were tears. People were handing in things with like eight point font with stuff like up the side. It was ridiculous and the whole point of it was to torture us to try to write concisely. Y'know, don't just blah everything all over the page. I tell my students that all the time. "If you can write something concisely then you can always fluff it out later. But if you're doing something that's short, every word has to count." So that was by far the best lesson I ever learned.
Tyler Bradbury & Allison Foley::  My most defining class was Chinese History with Andrew Hsieh, because he, I forget, how did it happen? He was my professor and so I knew who he was and then in the Scarlet and Black there was an advertisement for a school in China looking for an English teacher, my senior year, and I had applied for the French assistantship and had been wait-listed because the department nominated someone and I didn't realize I could've just applied through the program directly and gone anyway. So I was wait-listed and I was kinda like, "Oh, no, what am I gonna do. I'm getting ready to graduate," and I saw that and because I'd known... I knew him and he was my professor, I went and talked to him about it and I ended up, that's where I went after graduation, spent a year in China teaching. That was the beginning of my career.
Heather Riggs & Allison Foley::  If you were writing a history of Grinnell College, what events from your time would you include? Or not events, but y'know, social atmosphere, what would you include?
Allison Foley & Tyler Bradbury::  Y'know I don't know that I can think of any... overall ones because I think everyone's experiences here are so individualistic. I mean, we're obviously, we were close and we're obviously still close now but our college experiences were completely different, even if we lived together for two years. I don't know why they're so different but they really are. I mean, we hung out all the time. So, even going through the sort of same thing, I think people had very different ideas. I'm learning things about people now, like, "Really? That was your experience? I had no idea." I think there are things that are completely shared that are universal. Like that feeling that, "I don't belong here and I'm not smart enough." Remember Matt Belknap's song?
Allison Foley & Tyler Bradbury::  Feeling Stupid at Grinnell. It was very sweet. He has four kids, by the way.
Allison Foley & Heather Riggs & Tyler Bradbury::  think, I mean I think the big, the waltzes and things were always a big thing collectively. I still get stuck on the Bob's exotic dance night, which I somehow went to every single time without meaning to, always while studying for a final.
Allison Foley & Tyler Bradbury::  He was a jerk. But he got up there in the gorilla suit to 'Pour Some Sugar On Me' and like, writhed around in the gorilla suit and then pulled out a five pound bag of sugar, dumped it all over himself and rolled around in it, which was awesome objectively but turns out that somebody else had just done an act with water, so it took like three weeks to clean up Bob's. It was a mess, everyone was so mad. But, there was that. Oh, and Elizabeth Perrill did this- she would just, walked out and some normal song was playing and she like, undid all of her clothes, folded them quietly and then re-put them all back on and just walked offstage. That was pretty amazing. Oh, she had a baby recently, too.
Tyler Bradbury & Allison Foley::  There's so many people in North Carolina.
Tyler Bradbury & Allison Foley & Heather Riggs::  The swim team, the night that they all shaved for the…
Heather Riggs & Allison Foley::  Well I don't have any more questions, do you have anything to add?
Tyler Bradbury & Allison Foley::  Well yeah, I don't know. I always, whenever I see the group of friends that I had at Grinnell I'm always amazed that…
Tyler Bradbury & Allison Foley::  No. 2006 I was at your house. It was James that I hadn't seen since graduation.
Tyler Bradbury & Allison Foley::  But basically, the whole point being that every time- we can go for very long periods of time without being in contact.
Tyler Bradbury & Allison Foley::  Doesn't feel like ten years.
Tyler Bradbury & Heather Riggs & Allison Foley::  So yeah, I think... We good? Oh we did a thing, yay!
