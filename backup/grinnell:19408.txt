David Durand::  My name is Dave Durand. I currently live in Houston, Texas, and I'm a member of the Grinnell College Class of ’62. We’re here for our fiftieth reunion.
David Durand::  I came first time to Grinnell in the... well I guess it probably was the spring of ’58 ‘cause I was here visiting the campus and I didn’t have the chance to visit a whole lot of colleges but this was one I did- and... a very enjoyable experience. Got to see a play that was on that weekend, stay in one of the dorms, and get a chance to at least see what student life was like. But, I really came in the Fall of ’58. I should say at the outset, I was here for two years, ’59 and ’60. After that I transferred to Wheaton College, which is in a suburban Chicago area, for my last two years. I was a Chemistry major.
David Durand::  Came to Grinnell, really for two reasons. One, it was a very highly rated liberal arts school. I didn’t want to go to a big college. I figured it was better to have a chance to know more people. Having later gone on to the University of Illinois, I think that was a smart decision.
Sophie Haas & David Durand::  Yeah.
David Durand & Sophie Haas::  The one mistake I did make, offhand, is that music is very much a part of my life, it’s still my avocation, and the Music department at that time was not up to the par it was with some other departments. So, I sort of knew that when I came and I figured “Well, that’s not that important as long as it has the other things.” I was wrong. I was wrong. I really missed it, and that’s one reason I transferred.
David Durand & Sophie Haas::  So then, during some times when it wasn’t quiet hours during the day everybody’d gather in there and we’d play stuff.
David Durand::  The other thing- and I’ll comment, and this is gonna be probably not the usual thing you’ll hear from people in the thing, but I’m a Christian and became a Christian back when I was in high school. When I came here, it just- I didn’t find the nurture, if you will, for that group here on campus. It wasn’t that anybody was anti-Christian. That’s not the issue. It was just that the- I was looking for something and it wasn’t here, in the thing. So, the two reasons I ended up transferring to Wheaton were one, Wheaton is a Christian college outside of Chicago and it did have good music. But, also had good chemistry and stuff like that, and a small liberal arts college. So, it's sort of a thing. So you learn.
David Durand::  If I had to do it over again I would’ve thought more about what was really important to me at that time, and I would urge any student these days. A lot of times you don’t know when you’re young, when you come, what’s important to you. But if you sense that wherever you’re thinking of going there’s something that’s important to you that’s not going to be there, that’s a red flag. I didn’t recognize it at the time, nothing like that.
David Durand::  What did our dorm room look like? Well, looked messy most of the time. I lived in a triple. I don’t think that I know if they have those anymore, in North Younker Hall. At that time there was the men’s dorm and a women’s dorm. It was- there were no co-ed dorms. And I was up on the third floor in a triple and- there weren’t that many, there were only a few of those. I just signed to that. My second year I had a single all to myself.
David Durand & Sophie Haas::  The triple necessitated you making sure you got along with two roommates instead of just one and I remember one time, it was my freshman year, for some reason one of my, I don’t even know the reason, one of my roommates really got hacked off at me for something. And I was not really aware about it, and he came back one night, having had a few drinks. I was not in the room, and he got real mad. He threw my bed out the window. I mean, from the third floor. He was strong. He picked up the bed and threw it out the window and it landed three floors down on the sidewalk.
David Durand & Sophie Haas::  When I finally came back and saw, “What’s this bed doing out here?” y’know? “That looks like my bed,” y’know, and found out- probably just as well I wasn’t around. He probably would’ve thrown me out the window, but..
David Durand & Sophie Haas::  We decorated. My predilection was to decorate the wall, my part of the room, with signs. I collected signs. No Smoking, No Parking, whatever like that. But mostly, cardboard signs hung all over the room. One night, I decided to explore around town and actually went out and grabbed a couple signs from out along Park Street. One was a stop sign, big metal stop sign. And I went over a couple blocks and got a Route 146 sign, big metal things.
David Durand & Sophie Haas::  We si- I don’t know, maybe the guys- kids still do crazy things, yours too. Who knows? Anyway. But, that- one of the nice things about Grinnell at that time was the dorm life. Despite the fact that it was not co-ed or anything like that, it was very much of a camaraderie. It was like joining a fraternity, in effect, without the side things that aren’t good about a fraternity. And the same for the gals, in the sorority. And.. so, I enjoyed that-
David Durand & Sophie Haas::  Student life and campus life as experienced- Well, the ARH was here.
David Durand & Sophie Haas::  The Student Union, though, was really just sort of a... I won’t say a, Quonset hut but it was a very low-key type of thing. We spent a lot time over there, but I think it was held over from back during the war. It was built back then. Since then- where is.. the Forum? Is that where they have the- what they used to call the Student Union?
David Durand & Sophie Haas::  There were a lot of practical jokes as there are with any generation, things like that.
David Durand & Sophie Haas::  Another thing that became very common at that time was what we call pennying- like, using a penny. It was a- and what we would do is you go to the door, usually, and find something that you could pry it with or just push it in and insert several pennies between the door and the jamb. Once you did that the person inside a room could not turn the knob-
David Durand & Sophie Haas::  So yeah, practical jokes of that sort of thing. I remember, we had- of course you joined the Hall just like you would join a fraternity and at that time we had a hazing thing. I doubt they still do that, maybe- you know, wear the beanies that you've seen pictures of.
David Durand & Sophie Haas::  What I had to do, my assignment was to go down to Montezuma and wake up the Sheriff of the Poweshiek County, and get his signature on a piece of paper. I had to do it in the middle of the night.
David Durand & Sophie Haas::  So, what I remember, at 3 o’clock in the morning we’re knocking on the door of the Sheriff of the County.
David Durand & Sophie Haas::  But, there were some weird things. Like, somebody got sent over to the University of Iowa to wake up whoever was the quarterback for the football team at that time and get his signature.
David Durand & Sophie Haas::  I'd wanna- I’ve not been back to the campus, but- a couple times since then, just usually in passing.
