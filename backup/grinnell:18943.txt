Jean McKenzie::  Jean McKenzie from Eugene, Oregon, and I’m class of 1986.
Chelsie Salvatera & Jean McKenzie::  OK, cool. Heather out there is from Oregon as well.
Chelsie Salvatera::  OK. So first question. Why did you come to Grinnell College and what is your first memory of the campus?
Jean McKenzie & Chelsie Salvatera::  OK, I had come to Grinnell a couple of times with my older sister. I have a sister who’s just about fourteen months older than me, and what’s kind of funny is my sister Peggy is a genius, OK? She’s a very gifted pianist and it was just slightly painful coming through gradua- grammar school and high school right behind my sister Peggy because she was brilliant - I mean really off the scale. So my sister Peggy, after her junior year in high school had come right to Grinnell.
Jean McKenzie & Chelsie Salvatera::  Yeah, and so I would come and visit her and we had a lot of fun and everything but I wanted to give her her space. So I didn’t come to Grinnell initially, and I went, instead, to Beloit College.
Chelsie Salvatera & Jean McKenzie::  So was there a professor, student or staff member who had a particularly strong influence on your life?
Jean McKenzie & Chelsie Salvatera::  Who else? I participated in Marimba Band, and we had a Professor Ted Solis at the time, and he was really a big influence at that time. Really a neat guy and really had a lot of interest in Caribbean music and all kinds of stuff.
Chelsie Salvatera & Jean McKenzie::  What are the best memories of your time at Grinnell College?
Jean McKenzie::  Another thing I remember is this guy Mark, he’s married to his wife now, Sarah. He was a raku potter, and he just happened to say- I hung out in the Forum. Let me rephrase that: I lived in the Forum and sometimes I went home, back when it was right in the middle of campus where the Computer Center is right now. And so Mark said “Hey, what are you doing? You wanna take some photos? I need some for my senior project.” I was like, “Really? Oh, that’d be really cool. I'll take 'em black and white. You mind black and white?” And so I took a lot of really fun photographs and one of my best friends now, David Ellen, was running the Photography Lab and it was downstairs in that same Forum building.
Jean McKenzie::  What else? President Drake was the president at the time I lived here and one of my favorite memories is running into him in a very small town in Colorado called Marble, and there’s probably 100 people or fewer at Marble, Colorado. And all of a sudden I go, “Hey mom, I think that’s my president over there!” She’s like, “No, you’re trick – You're right! That’s George Drake!” So, it was fun.
Chelsie Salvatera & Jean McKenzie::  What did your dorm room look like? You can talk about your first year dorm, second year, any one...
Jean McKenzie & Chelsie Salvatera::  Yeah. I think it was in our room. I’m pretty sure it was. I don’t know. I can’t remember for a fact, and I only lived there for one semester and then I decided to create a house and the house that me and Nikki Carlson created was Juggling House. It’s over on 6. Highway 6, and it’s not there any longer. They just- Yeah, whatever.
Chelsie Salvatera & Jean McKenzie::  I had an alumni come by. She had- she started juggling club but no one... I guess they were the last, so I guess she wasn't the first? I should tell her you were the first.
Jean McKenzie & Chelsie Salvatera::  OK, now, I was a- I was definitely a punk.
Chelsie Salvatera & Jean McKenzie::  Alright, how about special occasions? On Waltz did you dress up, or..?
Chelsie Salvatera & Jean McKenzie::  What book influenced you most in college, if you can recall a book?
Chelsie Salvatera::  Okay. What memories or images do you have of the town of Grinnell?
Jean McKenzie::  When I was here, it was pre-Walmart, OK? So there was a couple of really cool places that.... The Louis Sullivan Bank was called Poweshiek National, and that’s where I kept my money, and I came here with, I think, two hundred dollars, and what was good about that is they had a five cent coffee place right next door. Cunningham’s, and you could get a malted over there, or a Candyland malt, or a bottomless cup of coffee which is what I did, was have bottomless coffee for five cents and eat Cunningham’s. And then there was also this place, Pamida, which, Pamida I think was officially a variety store but it was on the other side of sixth and you could get anything.
Jean McKenzie::  And a good friend of mine owned The Longhorn at the time, which was a steakhouse and burger joint, so he let me eat free there. He was, there was a- They were a gay couple of guys. Mark had gone to school here and then started a bagel run so he would provide bagels or deliver bagels and then he had dropped out of Grinnell and he had gotten with David, who owned the Longhorn.
Jean McKenzie::  The Louis Sullivan Bank had kind of a confessional where you would go up and... you kind of open the door and say you’d like to cha- checkout this much money. It was pretty fun. But other images- I did some student teaching here at one of the grammar schools about three blocks... What is that? It’s west, I guess, of campus and that was super fun. I taught in the fourth grade classroom and there was some of the kids from around town, and I’d see them here and there. It was really fun.
Chelsie Salvatera & Jean McKenzie::  Describe your favorite place on campus.
Chelsie Salvatera & Jean McKenzie::  I think I know what you’re talking about. In the ARH or in Burling?
Chelsie Salvatera & Jean McKenzie::  If you knew then what you know now, what would you have done differently during your time at Grinnell College?
Chelsie Salvatera & Jean McKenzie::  If you met -did you meet your spouse or partner here?
Chelsie Salvatera & Jean McKenzie::  Okay. That's awesome. Describe student and campus life as you experienced it during your time at Grinnell.
Jean McKenzie & Chelsie Salvatera::  Adam Burr, and this is a guy I knew in high school. Kim Counsel, I also knew her from high school. David Ellen, he’s out in Seattle. He works for Boeing. Kirstin’s back in Chicago after.. he’s originally from Brooklyn. Who else do I hang around with? I hang around with quite a few Grinnellians. Dan Mckewan.
Jean McKenzie & Chelsie Salvatera::  About ’84 to ’87.
Chelsie Salvatera & Jean McKenzie::  Okay, one final question. If you were writing a history of Grinnell College what would you include from your years here?
Jean McKenzie::  It was a little different from Beloit, and I had left Beloit thinking, "Well, I’ve taken all of my, maybe 7/8 of my Psychology coursework from this one professor, Deb Pool, and I thought, I don’t wanna get a degree in Deb Pool Psychology. I'd like to get a degree in Psychology."
Jean McKenzie & Chelsie Salvatera::  So I came over here and I take Lopatto, Frank Goodkin, this real brilliant guy, Tom Brosowski, and I still remember his final question was: Discuss the importance of sleep on the central nervous system. And I spent about fifteen minutes just pulling my hair out because I thought, “Oh, the importance of sleep! Oh, God! You're cramming all of this stuff - nothing had to do with sleep, nothing!” It was a good unifying question, but again, David Lopatto was my advisor and so I said, “Dr. Lopatto, do you want me to be on the selecting committee. I feel like we need more representation for selecting maybe a female faculty member.” He'd go, “Jean, we’re going to get the very best qualified psychologist that we can." It's like, “Yeah, yeah, I know, but how could a group of men select, and continue to select and always select male candidates?" "Dr. Goodkin was out of University of Michigan," and I’m like, “Yes, but he sleeps with students.”
Jean McKenzie::  There was also- Roberta Atkins was in Secondary Education and there was a couple of French professors who were female. Beverly Onning was here on campus as our pianist accompanist, and she was really fun. Babe Diedrickson was here in dance and there was a couple who taught in the art, and then there was also one female scientist, and the reason I mention her is she died with a group of students down caving in, I think, eight- very close by here. It was a whole caving accident that David Ellen had been on.
Jean McKenzie & Chelsie Salvatera::  But lasting legacies from the eighties, I think probably just the catching up of female academicians. The punk movement that was going on was really, y'know...
