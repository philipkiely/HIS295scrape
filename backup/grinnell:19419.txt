Alenka Figa::  Go ahead.
Ted Amann::  My name is Ted Amann. I currently live in Portland, Oregon, and I’m a member of the Grinnell College class of 1987.
Ted Amann::  So, let's see... Some of my best memories of Grinnell... One of my best memories, it’s sort of a series of memories, but it’s sort of a bittersweet thing. I was the Student Colle- or, Student Government President my senior year, and had a blast doing it. It was not something I intended to do. My junior year, there was only one person who was running for President and he was sort of the... well-known as the most Republican, conservative person on campus and I thought, “There’s no way that we can just let him run unopposed." It was like, "There’s gotta be some choice here.” So I decided, "All right, I’m going to run." I’d never been involved in student government, just sort of did it on, spur of the moment thing, and ended up getting elected and had a great time.
Ted Amann & Alenka Figa::  I mean I loved getting involved with the Student Government that year, and I think I did it ‘cause, I’m sort of a people-person. I loved getting to know different crowds on campus. Y’know, I had sort of my main crowd that I hung with, but... I was sort of part of the South Campus hippie crowd.
Ted Amann::  The downside was though, that I ended up having so much fun just being President and going to events and hanging out with people and also had a lot of time hanging on the Forum beach smoking pot and playing Frisbee, and it turned out that they also wanted me to still study.
Ted Amann & Alenka Figa::  And so, I’d forgotten that part and so, unfortunately, I don’t know if it ever happened to anyone else, I had to resign after fall semester because of academic reasons. 'Cause my GPA had dropped so much that they put me on suspension, and there’s rules that Student Government President can’t be on academic- er, not suspension.... was a warning or…
Ted Amann & Alenka Figa::  So I mean, they sort of put me on notice, like, "You gotta do better," so I came back and had to resign, which was not fun but it was so touching to be- I’d made, like, such a connection with the rest of the Student Government that the first meeting spring semester, when I had to officially resign and turn it over to the Vice President, then they made a motion and voted me King for Life-
Ted Amann & Alenka Figa::  And then, so that was back when we still had Relays as, y'know, the massive beer party that the Grinnell Relays were. I don’t know how much you know.
Ted Amann & Alenka Figa::  That’s great. They still do, ah, like the... drink a beer, run around the bases kind of thing?
Ted Amann & Alenka Figa::  But Titular Head back then was like a live talent show, so I’ve come to realize since then, I guess now it’s more of like a short film competition?
Ted Amann & Alenka Figa::  But, so we ended up doing a skit out of that, and.... which was basically a whole bunch of us dancing around on stage to the song and smoking pot on stage, and... But, they tied in the whole King thing. The people that were doing this got me up there, and so they found- we went into the theater department in the costumes and we found like a big purple, like, robe kinda like, king-like cape thing and they found me a crown, and so we ended up dancing around on stage with bongs and joints and stuff.
Ted Amann & Alenka Figa::  But we actually ended up with two faculty members coming up on stage and joining us.
Ted Amann & Alenka Figa::  Yeah, so they both came up and clearly we were the most popular act, in terms of like, you know, audience reaction, but we totally felt gypped because we ended up not winning. They gave the- well, we figured it was just politics, yeah, didn’t wanna celebrate too much. A whole bunch of people running around smoking pot but y’know that was certainly a big part of the campus life when I was here.
Alenka Figa & Ted Amann::  That would not happen today.
Ted Amann & Alenka Figa::  I mean, our understanding when we were here was that you step foot off campus, anything you do in town, y'know-
Ted Amann::  No, it was wide out there in the 80s. I was here ’83 to ’87 and... y’know we would sit on the Forum beach, what we called- yeah, the patio is outside there, and people would just be sitting there in the afternoon smoking joints and y'know, while we're- we’d be playing ultimate Frisbee out on the lawn and y'know, smoking while we’re playing or hanging out.
Ted Amann & Alenka Figa::  I mean it was- I’d see faculty members come in and out of the Forum and yeah, one of the professors we're in class with would stop and talk to us and it was just,not a big deal-
Ted Amann & Alenka Figa::  One of the things that really attracted me to Grinnell when I was coming here, I remember interviewing and I think it was the Dean, who made a comment to me about one of the things you’ll find here is that we work hard and we play hard. And I thought, "I like that," ‘cause y'know, I definitely came here to learn and learned a ton. But I also like to have fun, and yeah, really felt like we had a good balance of that, that we could, y'know, work hard during the day and then at night and on the weekends we could be as crazy as we wanted to be.
Ted Amann & Alenka Figa::  Let’s see, what other questions do I wanna do? Actually it’s sort of a question, one of my favorite things was hanging out on the South Campus loggia. I’m assuming people hang out on the loggia roofs, still?
Ted Amann & Alenka Figa::  Even in the winter time. I remember, it seemed like every year in February there was always one week where it warmed up and the sun came out. So even though it had been like bitterly cold, the sun would come out and it was nice the way the Loose loggia is where you got the flat part. Then, when it transitions to the sloped part, if you went right up against that wall of the flat part it created a windbreak.
Ted Amann & Alenka Figa::  You guys get bad winters here?
Ted Amann & Alenka Figa::  Yeah, I really learned about snow drifts coming to Iowa. I’d come from the East coast so I knew snow, but I had never really experienced the wind. Yeah.
Ted Amann & Alenka Figa::  So yeah, loggia was one of my favorite places on campus. The Pub was really nice.
Ted Amann & Alenka Figa::  So, yeah, that was great. At the end of the day, especially if you lived on South campus, you could just walk down there and, you know, it was really nice to just go down and have a beer. We had a tradition- if you remember, ever heard of the TV show Hill Street Blues? It was a really big, sort of police-procedural drama kind of show, but it was like this huge hit in the mid-80s, and so that was the tradition on- whatever night it was on, Thursday nights or something, was normally the Pub would open at 10 or 9 but this TV show was on an hour before the normal opening time, so on that one night they would open the Pub an hour early so that everyone could come down there and watch that TV show.
Ted Amann::  They had a jukebox in there and all of us from the same era, we all sort of have this list of songs that we all think of as “Pub Songs,” ‘cause those are the ones that were on the jukebox. And, so it was actually great, last night in the... where were we, the Langan Lounge, somebody had a tape of all the songs that had been on the jukebox and so- was playing that, those good memories.
Alenka Figa & Ted Amann::  What are some of the songs?
Alenka Figa & Ted Amann::  Did they have Alice in the 80s?
Ted Amann & Alenka Figa::  But yeah, I was actually a big part of the Alice in Wonderland parties, ‘cause I was the- for a couple years I was the main supplier of psychedelic mushrooms on the campus.
Alenka Figa & Ted Amann::  I can’t believe you FedExed mushrooms.
Ted Amann & Alenka Figa::  So... yeah, so we ended up sort of quickly... let’s see, friends of mine were living in Cleveland, so it was just, you know, right inside from- ‘cause we always did Alice down on the…
Ted Amann & Alenka Figa::  What do they do at Alice now?
Ted Amann & Alenka Figa::  Favorite academic experiences. Got a couple; I loved some of my psychology classes.
Ted Amann & Alenka Figa::  Actually, I don’t know if you’re a Dead Head, or know any, but there’s a picture inside one of their live albums where it’s like a picture of the band on stage and you can see the backs of the heads of the audience members, and he was in the front row at this concert. And so he pointed out, it's like, y’know, “That’s the back of my head!” and he had like, sort of a, y'know, big bushy like, 70s afro thing kind of going.
Ted Amann::  But he designed this course on decision-making, and it was fascinating spending- a whole semester was looking at the, you know, sort of the cognitive science of how do people make decisions. I mean it looked at, how do people evaluate risk, how do people interpret odds, that kind of stuff, but it was just fascinating to me. And it’s actually served me really well since then because I sort of got this really good understanding early on about what that process is and how do you make rational decisions as opposed to just sort of gut, emotional decisions that aren’t always really the best ones. So, that’s served me very well in my career, since then.
Ted Amann & Alenka Figa::  And the other class that really stood out for me was not something really connected to any work that I do or my major, but they did another one of these special courses where- it was actually several different professors got together and they did a course on nuclear weapons and arms control.
Ted Amann & Alenka Figa::  And so, it was the head of the Physics department, and he taught about, you know, the science of how nuclear weapons are made and how it works, you know, from a science point of view. The head of the History department, who talked about the historical aspects of how it came about and how it’s, you know, influenced history, and the head of the poly sci department talking about the whole political aspects of it, and it was just amazing. They would take turns sort of rotating and so, you know, each one of them, their sort of portion of the course had its own sort of arc but it was great ‘cause they were all intertwined and so each day we would go in and get another piece of it, and it was just fascinating.
Ted Amann::  I love it when they do that ‘cause, yeah, it’s just such a great experience, 'cause I always had trouble choosing classes ‘cause there were so many things I wanted to learn about, and it never seemed like there was enough time to take them all, always a challenge trying to whittle them down. So, I loved that kind of thing where you could get a lot of, sort of, different pieces of y'know, learning about something all in one course.
Ted Amann::  But the other thing about that course which, I was actually just recently talking with some friends of mine back in Portland who are about ten years younger than me and didn’t realize how for them, nuclear war was just sort of like an abstract thing and never really worried about it. And I mean, I think for everyone since- I think we were probably the last generation that, we actually really worried about that.
Ted Amann::  I mean, it was something that, you know, you actually wondered like, especially because Reagan had recently been elected and it’s interesting how Reagan’s perceived now, but at the time he was like, this total war-monger. He was, y’know, saber-rattling and all this, y'know, hard-line stuff, and people say it, y'know, would’ve eventually broke down the Soviet Union, y'know, but...
Ted Amann & Alenka Figa::  I mean, he started this huge escalation on the arms race, which basically bankrupted the Soviet Union ‘cause they couldn’t keep up, but we were producing all sorts of new weapons and nuclear missiles, and we always wonder, like, what’s going to happen if somebody says the wrong thing, hits the wrong button? And it just hadn’t occurred to me that that wasn’t part of everyone’s childhood, that-
Ted Amann & Alenka Figa::  There’s a movie. I think it’s called The Day After, that came out in-
Ted Amann & Alenka Figa::  Actually, here- that’s another weird thing. Here in ARH, I guess where we are now, this used to be the campus theater.
Ted Amann & Alenka Figa::  But no, this movie The Day After was actually a movie about what would happen if there was a nuclear war, and y'know, missiles hitting Kansas, like it was set around Kansas City so like, not that far away, and I mean, really just made the whole thing very real. It was kind of a scary thing at times.
Alenka Figa & Ted Amann::  You’re not obligated to answer all of the questions on there, by any means.
Ted Amann & Alenka Figa::  And I think it added a real rich sort of diversity to the campus, because you had a lot of different, you know, sort of perspectives and personality types, and so.. I don’t know to what extent that’s changed, but I hear it’s much more- sort of higher levels of academic achievement to get in.
