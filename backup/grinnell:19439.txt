Cynthia McKeen::  My name is Cynthia Peterson McKeen. I currently live in St. Paul, Minnesota, and I’m a member of the Grinnell College class of 1968. I had an unusual experience as a prospective student coming to Grinnell, because I was on the Rock Island Line coming from Western Iowa, on the day that John F. Kennedy was shot.
Tamara Grbusic & Cynthia McKeen::  Whoa.
Cynthia McKeen::  So, we stopped in Des Moines and I had an Uncle who was a special family member who had heard the news and knew I was on the train and came down and sat in the station. We sat there for a couple of hours because they were trying to decide, I suppose everything about transportation, and what was really going on in the country. And, thank goodness, he was there because I was by myself and I was used to being by myself, but it was a pretty crushing piece of news. And we didn’t know at first, if he was dead.
Cynthia McKeen::  So when I arrived on the Grinnell campus, I was met by some volunteer who took me to Grinnell House and who said, “Wel,l the last person who slept in the bed you’re going to sleep in tonight was Harry Truman.” My mother had been very active politically and knew Harry, ‘cause we’re Midwesterners together, and it seemed like such an odd confluence of Presidential things in my life.
Cynthia McKeen::  An upperclassman named Barb Plager was the person to take me around for the weekend, and, of course, the whole campus just shut down. Everybody was in shock. Films were canceled, you know. The meetings I was going to have were pretty much canceled. So, I ended up talking to students for the time that I was there and I certainly turned around and went home much sooner than I normally would have. But it was an odd way to come here. I had visited the campus when my brother went to school here ten years before, so I was somewhat familiar with things and really wanted to go to school here, I suppose because of my brother liking it so well. It was a strange introduction, to come that way.
Cynthia McKeen & Tamara Grbusic::  I don’t know what the configuration of dorms was then, but Barb and her roommates had like, a little sitting room and several separate bedrooms off of them.
Tamara Grbusic & Cynthia McKeen::  Did you like Cleveland?
Tamara Grbusic & Cynthia McKeen::  Were the dorms still segregated at that time?
Cynthia McKeen::  Every time I would go someplace on the train- ‘cause we came to college on the train then. The trains were still running. It was quite a sign-out procedure so they’d know where we were and when we were coming back. And when we’d come back, we had to sign in again; very different from now. I think we were right on the cusp of that changing. You know, it was ridiculous at that point and it changed pretty rapidly.
Tamara Grbusic & Cynthia McKeen::  How did that feel like, having segregated dorms and having guys on one side, girls on the other? Did you guys break rules?
Cynthia McKeen::  I was working two jobs to be able to afford it, and it was a strain for me when I came because although I had done fine in school and I’d done a lot of writing and thought that I had really studied hard, I came from a small school in Iowa. I tested out of all the Trigonometry, Math, Physics, everything because so few of us in a small school would be going on to college. So, the teachers almost custom taught us in those subjects that no one else was taking.
Cynthia McKeen::  So, I was able to handle all that fine, and I thought I would be OK. But, my first French class, I was the only one who had had no French. Everyone else in my French class had had four years in high school. So, I was studying extremely hard and was very tired, I think, because of it. It was nerve-racking. And, the way that I wrote wasn’t the style that I needed for paper-writing here, so it took me a while to learn that. I think the stresses were kind of great, and my roommate and I were talking about that last night and she felt the same thing, coming from a smaller school. So, we were very focused. It was like boot camp, for people like us. My social life, I dated some but not a lot because I was really occupied just keeping up with everything.
Cynthia McKeen::  I loved the films on campus, and because I loved to paint and draw they had me do the posters announcing what the films were going to be. So, the one thing I allowed myself every week was to go watch the TV in the basement in one of the dorms. I can't remember which one it was. But, I would make posters and listen to The Man from U.N.C.L.E. That really dates... really dates us.
Cynthia McKeen & Tamara Grbusic::  I noticed in the photos from the 1966 yearbook that the only picture there that really relates to the people I knew very well in Cleveland or in the jobs that I was doing at the library, the picture from Cleveland Hall is that there are big paper flowers that are on wire stems pushed into the ground in front of the Loggia. I made about 80 of those and so did others in Cleveland, and that was our project.
Cynthia McKeen::  Clothes, what kind of clothes did we wear every day? We wore nylon stockings and dresses, and I was a tomboy growing up. My dad was a physician, a small town physician and an organic person way before most people were interested. I loved the garden. I loved climbing trees. I was very active and I was totally offended by having to be dressed in high school and college in a way that I found just, I didn’t have the patience for it. So, we were still wearing dresses and skirts and sweaters and matched sweater sets and all those things.
Tamara Grbusic & Cynthia McKeen::  Was there, like, a dress code in Grinnell?
Cynthia McKeen::  So, we had a family crisis where there was... we were really going to be strapped for money and I transferred to Drake University and went into the Art department and just took hours and hours and hours to catch up to make a really solid Art major. I would come back and forth to Grinnell quite a bit on weekends because I had friends and a boyfriend here. I missed things about Grinnell, but it certainly set me up to be able to work quite soon and actually earn money in art which was not an easy thing to do in those days. It wasn’t what most women did.
Cynthia McKeen::  So, that was a big shift. What I loved about transferring is that art students get to wear whatever they want because you’re doing so much messy work all the time. It felt like going home, on that level. It’s interesting that a few years later I came back to visit and everybody was dressing like I was back then. So, it- Again, it was a little bit of a cusp when we were here. It was change time.
Tamara Grbusic & Cynthia McKeen::  You guys started it, yeah?
Cynthia McKeen & Tamara Grbusic::  It’s very special and coming back has felt wonderful because it’s like stepping right back into it.
Cynthia McKeen::  I think that I was discouraged by several professors here which surprised me. I grew up in a totally Danish community where people are very direct, but they’re also not really... I did not grow up with a lot of manipulative people or people who would challenge you in what felt like a mean way. I don’t think I was particularly self-pitying. I had a couple professors who I think were... felt that I probably was light-duty to be here. That was a very useful experience because I talked to upperclassmen to say, “What do you do when this happens?” and they gave me clues, and it worked.
Cynthia McKeen::  And as I went into art and had to deal with really tough clients, was I ever prepared. Now, that was a kind of education I had not expected to find at Grinnell. That competitive and really tough kind of “Do you really think you belong here?” attitude inspired in me a determination to say, “Well, who are you to say that to me?” So, that was a very useful piece of my education, and probably one of the most valuable pieces, in a lot of ways.
Cynthia McKeen::  I loved the Art department here and had we had more money I would’ve liked to do that and go on to grad school. Because I went to Drake and lived with an elderly aunt who was very ill and who I adored, I learned a lot of things I needed to know for later in life about taking care of my many senior relatives, because I was the youngest in a big immigrant family of people who were way older than I was. She was a darling and she was a writer and it was a useful experience.
Cynthia McKeen::  But, because it saved a lot of money, I, then, after graduating, was able to go to Denmark, which I wanted to do. I had visited there once before. It was the height of... the real mecca of Danish design and I went with the understanding that I would be mentored by a woman who was famous in weaving. But when I got to the place where I was to be living in and learning from her, she had run off with an Italian, and she didn’t come back.
Cynthia McKeen::  So I ended up going to the Art Institute in Copenhagen, the Kunst Academy. A friend of the family introduced me to the idea and said, “I’ve set up an appointment for you.” I walked into the office of the head of the school, and being 22 and outspoken Dane and truly excited, I recognized this man. I said, “My God, you’re Ole Wanscher,” in Danish. I had no idea I was going to meet- that this was his name.
Cynthia McKeen::  Ole Wanscher was a furniture designer. His father had been a famous art historian of furniture. He did all the best books about the history of furniture from Egyptian times on. And for my graduation from college present my mother had given me his new book, Ole Wanscher’s new book, which was the history of all these chairs. And I was fascinated by the design of chairs because the leverage and the weight and the balance and the beautiful materials. So, I knew who he was because his picture was on the paper cover of the book. I think he was as startled that a young American knew who he was, as I was startled that I was in the, you know, presence of a hero.
Cynthia McKeen::  So, they custom designed a course of study for me and I ended up working in the two big design stores of Copenhagen for the time that I was there, because he said, “This way you will meet all the designers, and you will work with all the materials and you will learn everything that you could ever want to learn about the display and exhibition of this kind of work."
Cynthia McKeen::  He said, “Because you’ve come in late in the year with the fiasco of your mentor, then you can start taking courses at the next semester but this will really pull you into the middle of it and I think you will have a good time,” which I did. It was remarkable. So I ended up meeting all of the well-known furniture designers that I had studied, and it was a very heady experience. I had to do some work to earn some money, and my first job was cleaning eel which was a totally unpleasant job. But, I soon found that I could do extra hours at the stores and earn money and so that worked. So I had a very odd kind of personalized experience that has stayed with me. Then, I was there for about half a year and I got the news that my father had had a very bad stroke and I would need to come home.
Cynthia McKeen & Tamara Grbusic::  So, my life changed from that point because then I became a caregiver for about 16 years in addition to working. It was a wonderful thing that I had this intensely fine education here and in the group where I was at Drake and in Denmark, because I didn’t have time to experience that kind of living again for quite a long time. I think that’s also sharpened my feelings of appreciation for Grinnell. You take a major and you never know what you’re going to end up doing.
