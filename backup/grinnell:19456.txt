Carly Schuna::  My name is Carly Schuna. I live in Madison, Wisconsin and my class year is 2006.
Chelsie Salvatera & Carly Schuna::  OK. So Carly, why did you come to Grinnell College and what is your first memory of the campus?
Carly Schuna::  Um, yeah, I sat in on a couple of classes. I could tell that they were really hard and challenging and I liked that one of the students in one of the classes turned around and said welcome to me with like, a really big, genuine smile on his face and it made me feel really good. Yeah, so, I mean, I never really wanted to go anywhere else. It was clear to me that this is where I wanted to go to school and I certainly haven’t regretted it. I’m very glad that I went here.
Chelsie Salvatera & Carly Schuna::  Awesome. OK. Was there a professor, student or staff member who had a particularly strong influence on your life?
Carly Schuna::  He is the best. So awesome. I was in his tutorial, which was on Frankenstein, so it was a really cool Tutorial. We watched like, Young Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein. Sometimes we would go have class at his house. We would have breakfast with him. It was really great. He was just like, the kindest professor- made everybody feel really really welcome. He was an excellent advisor and probably like, the smartest person that I’ve ever met and the smartest person that I ever still know. Just like, so intelligent and considerate and wonderful in every way. It was great to work with him while I was here.
Carly Schuna::  And then another student that I can remember in particular was my friend J.R., who unfortunately- he was killed in a car accident when he was driving back to Grinnell over winter break. This was, I think my junior year, so his sophomore year. He was class of ’07. His name was J.R. Ewins. And- oh, he was just like one of my best friends at Grinnell. I met him when he was a prospie. He was a good friend of the guy that I was dating at the time, when he came as a prospective student. He had just the hugest smile, such a nice guy. So yeah, he and I hit it off right away and we remained really really close friends.
Carly Schuna::  He would always come and knock at my door and come in to study in my room. I was a Student Advisor, so he would come in and just- He had this distinctive way of knocking at my door where he would not, like, show himself. He would just knock with his hand so it was impossible to tell it was him until I said something and he came in and showed himself. Yeah, he always did that and he would come in and just hang out in my room for hours at a time with all of his textbooks. He would fall asleep in my room. But yeah, he and I were really really close, so it was awful for me to hear about his death but I know that there are a lot of students who will always remember him. But yeah, he was definitely a complete shining beacon during my time at Grinnell. So, he’s one of my favorite Grinnell memories.
Chelsie Salvatera & Carly Schuna::  Okay. What are your best memories of your time at Grinnell College?
Chelsie Salvatera & Carly Schuna::  OK. I like that answer. What did your dorm room look like? You can talk about all four, first one, anything.
Carly Schuna::  Yeah, sophomore year I had a bit of a bigger room because I was a Student Advisor, so I had a loft bed and.. Actually sophomore year, I think my friends and I always had this thing where we would celebrate each other’s birthdays in surprising ways. So, for my birthday sophomore year all of my friends hand-wrote down all of these poems that they thought were beautiful by like a wide variety of poets and there were dozens and dozens of them. There were probably like 200 or more, and on my birthday they broke into my dorm room while I was gone and put them all up on the wall all over my room, so my whole room for sophomore year was covered with poetry. Like, the ceiling, the walls, the floor, everything. So, that was pretty awesome. Yeah, I mean, that’s what I remember the most. My other dorm rooms were all kind of boring so that was probably the coolest decoration I ever had.
Chelsie Salvatera & Carly Schuna::  What kind of clothes did you wear everyday as a Grinnell student, or on special occasions?
Chelsie Salvatera & Carly Schuna::  Okay. What book influenced you most in college?
Carly Schuna::  So, in the writing classes that I took I would be writing children’s literature and everyone else would sort of be writing like, Great American Novel type of things so no one ever really understood this stuff that I was working on. It was sort of enigmatic even to a lot of the professors, so I was reading a lot of children’s books in my spare time in college. I don’t know if any of them stands out in particular, but after I graduated I was awarded a Post Baccalaureate fellowship in the humanities and I studied Humor in Children’s Literature for that semester after I graduated, and I was paid to just read picture books and middle-grade novels and young adult novels like basically all day, and find out more about children’s literature humor. So that was the best, and I would say that was... Y'know, those books were most influential on me when I was here at Grinnell ‘cause they relate most directly into what I do now.
Chelsie Salvatera & Carly Schuna::  Right. Okay. What memories or images do you have of the town of Grinnell?
Chelsie Salvatera & Carly Schuna::  How has Grinnell changed since you were a student?
Chelsie Salvatera & Carly Schuna::  Okay. Describe something that is no longer available on campus but that was meaningful to you. For example: buildings, programs, activities....
Chelsie Salvatera & Carly Schuna::  Okay. Describe your favorite academic experience or class at Grinnell.
Chelsie Salvatera & Carly Schuna::  Where am I? Describe your favorite place on campus.
Carly Schuna & Chelsie Salvatera::  And where... oh, where else? I was thinking of one more place. Oh, favorite place on campus... I can’t remember it now. It was… Well, I like Mac Field. I think Mac Field is beautiful. I like the Observatory as well, but yeah. And there was one more place but it’s gone out of my head.
Chelsie Salvatera & Carly Schuna::  If you knew then what you know now, what would you have done differently during your time at Grinnell College?
Chelsie Salvatera & Carly Schuna::  Okay. Did you meet your spouse, partner at Grinnell?
Chelsie Salvatera & Carly Schuna::  Okay. Describe student and campus life as you experienced it during your time at Grinnell.
Chelsie Salvatera & Carly Schuna::  OK, this is kind of a broad one too. If you were writing a history of Grinnell College, what would you include from your four years here?
Carly Schuna::  But, I don’t know. I guess... I mean, some of the things that I remember mostly that are Grinnell-specific are, self-governance is one thing that seems to be notably different from what other colleges have and I think Grinnell’s system of self-governance works very well and is most of the time very effective. Also, the open curriculum and the fact that you can choose whatever classes you want, that was one of the things that really attracted me when I was looking at schools and I still think it’s such a great thing. But, y'know, I had to take some math and science courses but I could pick which ones I wanted, and I only had to take a few and there was no core curriculum that I had to take. I just loved that kind of freedom being available and being able to choose what kind of classes you want, so.... Yeah. That is an awesome thing. But, yeah, I think those are the main things.
Chelsie Salvatera & Carly Schuna::  Okay. Do you have any other things you want to add on? Anything else you want to talk about?
