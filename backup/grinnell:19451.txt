Karen Adkinson Reixach::  I’m Karen Adkinson Reixach. I live in Rochester, New York, now, and I am in the class of 1966.
Mark Schorr & Karen Adkinson Reixach::  And I’m Mark Schorr, and I live in Andover, Massachusetts, and I’m also a member of the class of ’66. And we- Karen suggested that the two of us describe our favorite academic experience at Grinnell because we think it’s the same experience, more or less.
Karen Adkinson Reixach & Mark Schorr::  And... I’m not sure how I got picked. Do you have any idea how you got picked?
Karen Adkinson Reixach & Mark Schorr::  But the opportunity was to live in an apartment on the near North side, right around the corner from the Newberry Library, and there were two professors, one from Coe College who was a historian, and one professor who was an English professor. Both of them had specialties in Renaissance studies and so that was the focus of our semester at the Newberry.
Karen Adkinson Reixach & Mark Schorr::  The program consisted of five weeks of class and then producing a paper using the resources of the library, and we also had field trips and sort of seminars during those five weeks. One of the ones that was most thrilling for me was when we went down to the Art Institute and they brought out the sort of, Renaissance print collection. I mean, Albrecht Durer print right there! It was…
Mark Schorr & Karen Adkinson Reixach::  And a few days after looking at that manuscript at the Art Institute, I found myself working on an actual, medieval Renaissance manuscript at the Newberry under the careful direction of this Oxford professor. Terrifying. And, with not very good Latin, and less Greek, but it still was the most exciting experience and he began to have me looking for a certain change in handwriting that he had a theory about. About the- the author of that manuscript.
Karen Adkinson Reixach::  I think that for me, back in the Dark Ages when I did English literature here, it was... the focus was New Criticism which really said that text speaks for itself. So, you didn’t need all of this historical, textual, editorial stuff. You engaged the texts. So, to go to a research library and sort of be cornered into a totally different mode of thinking about literature was... I would say, a little challenging for me. And I evaded it as much as I could. I was not a- I was naughty.
Mark Schorr & Karen Adkinson Reixach::  Well, and it was also in the age before computers.
Karen Adkinson Reixach & Mark Schorr::  I remember staying up till two or three in the morning with, y’know, white-out-
Mark Schorr & Karen Adkinson Reixach::  And mine had Greek and Latin to add to the manuscript as well, and to make matters worse, our papers- unlike the usual college papers, because this was the first experience of the Newberry. The Newberry had an in-house bindery. So they said, “We’re going to publish your papers.”
Mark Schorr & Karen Adkinson Reixach::  Yes, and I look over it and I still see my mistakes to this day. Oh, and I say, "Where is more white-out? White-out? Correct tab? Where are you?"
Karen Adkinson Reixach & Mark Schorr::  I went to graduate school in English literature at the University of Chicago, and when I got there I was just profoundly disappointed because I had thought that it was going to be like the Newberry where you had access to the professors readily, and... It- graduate school wasn’t a thing like that.
Mark Schorr & Karen Adkinson Reixach::  Well, you were profoundly disappointed. I went on to Harvard English graduate school. I was only... partially disappointed. I did actually have a course at Harvard from William Bomb, the librarian at Houghton, that was very much like the Newberry experience.
Mark Schorr & Karen Adkinson Reixach::  And, he would bring, just as we had with the Newberry, he would bring a cart full of books. “Oh, this is just Keats’ copy of Dante, nothing special.”
Karen Adkinson Reixach & Mark Schorr::  Yeah, I think that one of the other things about the experience was the other students because, y’know, Mark and I were from Grinnell, but we had three wild people from Carleton. We had somebody from St.- one or two –
Karen Adkinson Reixach & Mark Schorr::  And Paul loved music, so we would all go and sit in the nosebleed zone, up in the, y'know-
Mark Schorr & Karen Adkinson Reixach::  Paul loved Mozart and Laurie loved Toscanini. And so we would- he would play all the complete records of Toscanini while he was typing my paper.
Mark Schorr & Karen Adkinson Reixach::  But, the other- another aspect, I had a job as a page at the Library and that was also a great work experience that completely complimented what we were doing. So we would get on- we would be patrons of the Library, and then we’d get on the other side of the desk and we’d be helping people. So, we were much better patrons. Much more...
Mark Schorr & Karen Adkinson Reixach::  And also, in those days, the Newberry- We were staying at a set of garden apartments that were owned by the Newberry, that eventually they sold, but they were- They sold it to pay to build up their endowment. But we, at the time, Poetry Magazine was headquartered there as well, so we got to know Poetry Magazine.
Mark Schorr & Karen Adkinson Reixach::  So, another way that that was a life-changing experience for us, we realized that all of us were liberal arts students and we had a kind of... it was a validation of our careers here at Grinnell that we met other students who were interesting in different ways. Maybe slightly different styles, or….
Karen Adkinson Reixach & Mark Schorr::  I mean, it was really- just being together and, of course, you, you know, you were sort of- There were what, fifteen of us, or twelve? I forget the number, but it was a small group and, y'know, we didn’t know anybody else. Well, you knew 'cause you were from Chicago, but the rest of us really, we just had each other. So, that’s- we bounced off each other, we talked about, y'know, our papers or life in general. And it just was a wonderful sort of community experience, as well as, kind of the academics that we were provided by the, y'know, the program. So, I- It’s still going, right?
Tamara Grbusic & Karen Adkinson Reixach & Mark Schorr::  Newberry Program?
Mark Schorr::  But, uh, another way that it was broadening for me, personally, and I think for some of the others: I was from Chicago, as Karen mentioned, and Chicago is a city of neighborhoods. You grow up in the neighborhood. The neighborhoods are handed from one group to another, but they're still- they don’t really change that much, and you grow up with this kind of ethnic perspective.
Mark Schorr & Karen Adkinson Reixach::  But, downtown at the center, Navy Pier, the near North side, is the center of the city where all the neighborhoods meet.
Karen Adkinson Reixach & Mark Schorr::  So, I don’t know. Do you have other things-? Well, you wanted to talk a little bit about coming back to campus and what it was like.
Mark Schorr::  And got back to Grinnell and... had never, had never taken a course from Jim Kissane, and signed up for a spring course, but that course- There was a subtle change in my thinking when I came back that I didn’t realize ‘til years later, but that- We began to meet in the spring term. Snow melted. We found a good tree on Central campus and had four or five topics we wanted to talk about: Victorian- The Victorian Sage and the history of the novel.
Mark Schorr & Karen Adkinson Reixach::  And this conversation began. It was very much like the conversations with our profs at the Newberry, and I realized the conversational- the possibilities of conversational mode of teaching and learning. And, y’know something? That conversation with Jim Kissane, it’s now 40-some years later; it’s still going. It switched from under the tree, to, gradually, to letters, then to email, but it’s still going. And I owe him a letter when I get back next week.
Karen Adkinson Reixach & Mark Schorr::  I came back to campus and got mono-
Karen Adkinson Reixach & Mark Schorr::  Well, I’d taken, you know, Chaucer with Ed Foster, and had been captured by that period and actually, y’know, did a little bit of Chaucer at the University of Chicago. Laurie Cherniak, there were five of us who ended up at the University of Chicago, from, you know, from the Newberry program, and Laurie Cherniak from Carleton said, “Oh! You’ve gotta take- You’ve gotta just, audit!
Karen Adkinson Reixach::  So, you know, you develop these appreciations for- ‘cause I was shy. I mean, I was studious, but I was quite shy so the thought of kind of striking up a conversation with a professor was not something that would have occurred to me. And I think that the Newberry helped in kind of lowering my expectations of myself around that, and...
Mark Schorr & Karen Adkinson Reixach::  Well, they- the professors both made a point of inviting us to their...
Karen Adkinson Reixach & Mark Schorr::  Did you-? I think that Laurie and maybe Fran and I, and I don’t know if you were there but we drove out to Coe to see Van Fossen the next year.
Karen Adkinson Reixach & Mark Schorr::  Well, also, he was very strongly opposed to the Vietnam War and things got a little hot in this small College in Iowa. Unlike Grinnell, which, of course, was totally calm about the Vietnam War, hahaha. So he- I think he sort of had a push, as well as a pull, to Canada.
Karen Adkinson Reixach & Mark Schorr::  So, I wanna talk a little bit about the yearbook.
Mark Schorr & Karen Adkinson Reixach::  Those were the film days.
Karen Adkinson Reixach & Mark Schorr::  So, it was really... It was a wonderful experience to have them taking seriously what was going on and trying not just to show the kind of... superficial stuff, but trying to show the life of the mind, so that the pictures- it wasn’t just- Usually, in yearbooks, you get the pictures of the faculty and that’s the last you see of them, but I think in our yearbook what we tried to do was to incorporate a sense that this was a college where people actually studied and-
Mark Schorr & Karen Adkinson Reixach::  They had a huge feature, as is illustrated in the show that’s over- that they’ve mounted, but they had a huge section on the Library, and it was really the first time that the new Burling Library was featured as an essential component of college life. You’d look through the typical yearbook of anyone, and there’d be a few obligatory pictures of people studying. But here was a whole section on the culture of the Library, the life of the Library, how to sleep in the Library, how to- everything you could possibly think of.
Mark Schorr & Karen Adkinson Reixach::  And again, with purposefully minimalist captions that- I was talking to them last night, we were-
Mark Schorr & Karen Adkinson Reixach::  Yeah, they took many good things from the ’65 and Henry was saying last night that you trained them, Karen.
Karen Adkinson Reixach & Mark Schorr::  And I think the other thing that I- I want to brag a little bit. Not just turning them loose, but there was, besides the conversation about the equipment in the darkroom, which I also weighed in about – on their side – but, there was another candidate for the editorship of the yearbook who would've produced- He was a perfectly competent photographer, but he would have produced a fairly pedestrian book. And so, I really advocated that Henry and, y'know, John be selected as editors of the yearbook, and I think that there were lots of reservations about them, and I kind of insisted that, you know, they had to use these guys because they were just such superb photographers, and that they would produce a book that would be talked about for... well, now it’s going on 46 years, isn’t it?
Mark Schorr::  Yeah, part of it was because of the controversy that it was withheld in limbo for 20 years. It was held in limbo in a bank vault in Poweshiek County National Bank, but then released to some fanfare 20 years later. Time Magazine did a cover story on it- not a cover story, a story on the yearbook that now, finally, was produced, and-
Mark Schorr & Karen Adkinson Reixach::  But more importantly, it was the yearbook itself that had- it really caught this kind of golden age before the seriousness, the enormity of Vietnam settled on the entire country. There’s one photograph of six students with handwritten signs in the hall, down the hall of ARH, this very building, protesting the CIA recruiter coming to Grinnell. That story was picked up on the Des Moines Register wire service and ran coast to coast.
Mark Schorr & Karen Adkinson Reixach::  And... That- they caught the protests that were beginning to emerge. They had a special section on radicalism on the campus and the students who were branching out to the protest movements.
Karen Adkinson Reixach & Mark Schorr::  So you had these two almost competing cultures side-by-side simultaneously. And what- I think what Henry and John did was to really capture that watershed moment as we move out of the 50s. I mean, it was ’66 but we were a little slow.
Mark Schorr & Karen Adkinson Reixach::  The first big demonstrations broke out at Berkley and Harvard, a year or two later. Then, they were mirrored here at Grinnell in different ways. But, the little demonstrations that were depicted in this book broke out before those demonstrations at the campus, before the Berkley free speech movement got started, as far as I know.
Karen Adkinson Reixach & Mark Schorr::  I remember the conversation right before we graduated, with you, and as a woman, I didn’t have to worry about the draft. And all the men in our class were scrambling to figure out how they were not going to go to Vietnam, and, as a woman, it really weighed on me that I was exempt simply because I was a woman.
Mark Schorr & Karen Adkinson Reixach::  And I- you know, I did eventually have high enough blood pressure that they didn’t want me, but the- I felt bad for years. One of my classmates, John Baloben, went and worked as a nurse in Vietnam, and I felt that I should do something like that. He was very committed, Quaker.
Karen Adkinson Reixach & Mark Schorr::  And, of course, John had, John Phillips, who was the other Editor of the yearbook, went to Canada because of the war. And so, he developed his whole career in Canada.
Karen Adkinson Reixach & Mark Schorr & Tamara Grbusic::  So, well, we could gas on for hours, couldn’t we?
