Kathryn Vincent::  I'l have you start with name, city of current - you currently live in, and class year.
John Aubry & Kathryn Vincent::  Okay. My name is John Aubry. I am currently living in Stone Ridge, New York- actually dividing my time between New York City and Stone Ridge, and I’m a member of the Class of ’77.
John Aubry::  I was influenced by some high school friends who knew of Grinnell and when the Grinnell rep. came to my high school, they said, “Oh, why don’t you come along and talk to this guy?” And I did and was just very impressed with the description of the College and the notion of a small liberal arts college was pretty foreign to anything I was aware of in Oklahoma. At that time, I don’t think there was a single liberal arts college in the state. They later- they tried to start one later and it didn't- Oklahoma is not really the right environment for a liberal arts college. You put that word in there and it causes problems in a place like Oklahoma. But I was really taken by it, and... put in my application.
John Aubry::  There was actually sort of story about that, because my folks weren’t really keen on me going out of state. They thought it would be, you know, too far away, and that I’d be subject to all of these bad influences, I think- though they didn’t quite say it- put it that way, but I think that was part of their thinking, and--
John Aubry::  Also, it was expensive compared to what my father thought: "Do the first two years at Tulsa Junior College. You can live at home, save a whole lot of money and the first two years of this- of college are the same wherever you go," and so forth. So I really had to argue a lot to overcome their resistance to even get the application, and to get the check- you know, the... fee, the application fee and all that, but they agreed. I kept saying, “Oh, probably won’t even get in." Y'know, "I probably won't. Probably won't, you know. Let’s just try. Let’s just send it off.” But, the application went in, the acceptance letter came along with a little bit of financial aid, you know, enough to make a difference, and more importantly, it was enough that it- somehow that just totally broke down my father’s resistance. He said, “Well, if they’re willing to invest that much in you, I guess I should too if they-” you know.
John Aubry::  So that was- That was the... That sort of broke the barrier, and at that time he said, “Do you want to go up and see the place before you accept?” And, it was a long way to go; it would have been an expense and so forth, and I said, “I don’t think it’s going to change my decision, so no. Let’s just wait until August and I’ll go up then.” So, that’s what we did.
John Aubry::  So I arrived on campus, had never seen it before. They drove me up. My folks drove me up, and...oh, I was just... I was in, really, a state of shock, delirium, you know. I was really excited at meeting my roommates, and seeing the dorm, and just seeing the campus. It was... It was just sort of an amazing place to be. I said goodbye to the folks, which was- it was hard for my mother, you know, that she-- I think she knew that once I was here, then Oklahoma would not really be my home again, and I was on my way to wherever I was going, but.. that was sort of the experience of getting here.
Kathryn Vincent & John Aubry::  Mhm. Was there a professor, student, or staff member who had a particularly strong influence on your life?
Kathryn Vincent & John Aubry::  Mhm.
John Aubry & Kathryn Vincent::  I thought I knew how to write, I’d done well in high school, but it was a totally different thing, and I have sort of had a reputation in the place I worked, as... Writing is something that I find easy to do, find... I’m called upon to do it a lot. I haven’t done as much writing as I’d like to. That’s something I’m sort of looking forward to in retirement, is, maybe that. But, no I think that was a moment I remember and I think that learning to write, and... If you can think clearly, you can write clearly, and if you can’t write it clearly, then you need to think it through some more.
Kathryn Vincent & John Aubry::  What are some of your best memories of your time at Grinnell?
Kathryn Vincent & John Aubry::  Was that in the beginning of Independent majors or had they been around for a while?
Kathryn Vincent & John Aubry::  What did your dorm room look like while you were here?
John Aubry::  I remember some friends down the hall, they had taken India Print bedspreads and they had really made it nice and sort of warm and theirs was a great room to hang out in.... Hang out there and smoke and drink beer, and listen to music. It was a place that everybody sort of gathered at. Our room was not like that. Our room was really spartan.
John Aubry & Kathryn Vincent::  And then I lived.... I lived in Cowles, had a two-room double which was sort of nice then.
John Aubry & Kathryn Vincent::  I took a lot of Russian. I, at one time, was going to major in Russian, but I changed my mind on that one... But I did live in Russian House and that was a lot of fun. That was a great place to be. And then my senior year I was in a nice, big single on the top floor of Main, right above the Pub. That was so convenient.
Kathryn Vincent & John Aubry::  What kind of clothes did you wear every day as a Grinnell student, and would you dress up for any special occasions?
Kathryn Vincent & John Aubry::  What book influenced you most in college?
Kathryn Vincent & John Aubry::  What memories or images do you have of the town of Grinnell?
John Aubry::  Going for doughnuts, 2 o’ clock in the morning, did that fairly often. I even remember the movie theater. I went there a few times. Most of the movies were on campus. That was a big thing then. I don’t know if it is now, but that was a big part of my education, as much through friends- One friend in particular, whose father had taught film at SUNY Stony Brook, but- and so he really knew movies, really knew films, was, “Oh, you gotta’ see this one! You gotta see this one!” So, a lot of Friday and Saturday nights were spent on campus. I remember The Longhorn was a major... That was sort of a treat to go there. I had my first mixed drink at The Longhorn.
Kathryn Vincent & John Aubry::  Describe student and campus life: you’ve been talking about the movies, anything else that sticks out in your memory?
Kathryn Vincent & John Aubry::  How has Grinnell changed since you were a student?
Kathryn Vincent & John Aubry::  Describe something that is no longer available on campus, but that was meaningful to you: buildings, programs, activities?
John Aubry & Kathryn Vincent::  Has it been sort of in this state that it is in now your entire time at Grinnell?
Kathryn Vincent & John Aubry::  It's a cool design, too.
Kathryn Vincent & John Aubry::  Describe your favorite academic experience or class at Grinnell.
John Aubry::  They were- the one I remember most strongly, was, it was team-taught by Peter Connelly, Beryl Clotfelter, Morris Parslow, and Don Smith, and it was on the Enlightenment, so it was… I guess the credits were for history and literature, or maybe you could do- get credits for whatever you needed them for, but you know, we were reading the primary sources, reading them in a small group discussion, but, there was really... very little lecture. It was mostly led-discussion. Questions, probing in the works, reading these works on the Enlightenment…
John Aubry & Kathryn Vincent::  I’ll never forget, towards the end of the class, maybe one of the last sessions, we were talking about Rousseau and I was saying something, and, I don't- who knows what I was saying, but Morris Parslow turned to me said, “Now if you understand what you just said,” as if there was a real possibility that I didn’t, which, of course, there was, “If you understand what you just said, you’ve got the gist of the course.”
John Aubry & Kathryn Vincent::  Because, another time, a classmate had been talking, you know, getting- you get in that stream, and so forth, and the bell rang and the guy kept talking, kept talking, and Professor Parslow very nicely said, "It’s okay. You don’t have to make any sense after the bell rings."
John Aubry & Kathryn Vincent::  There were a lot of- I did a lot of those multi- I did one on the- an eight credit one on the Victorian Period: Imperialism and Industrialism. I did the Russian 12 credit, which was 4 credits of political science, 4 credits of history, and 4 credits of Russian, I think were the... And it was- so, Russia in the 20th century. So the whole Revolutionary Period, the whole Cold War, it was intense.
John Aubry & Kathryn Vincent::  That’s what made me decide: no, I really don’t want to be a Russian major. Although, I loved the Russian department, the faculty, and... they were just great. I still know a little bit of Russian, though I don’t have much opportunity to use it, but.. It was a really strong department here and attracted a lot of really good, interesting students.
Kathryn Vincent & John Aubry::  Describe one of your favorite places on campus.
Kathryn Vincent & John Aubry::  If you knew then what you know now, what would you have done differently during your time at Grinnell?
Kathryn Vincent & John Aubry::  If you met your spouse or partner at Grinnell, describe how you met.
John Aubry::  If anything, they may be- you may be more directed, more focused than we were. A lot of us were here sort of trying to figure out what we were going to do, but I think it was easier to be that way. I think maybe it's... It's- people are aware that it’s more incumbent upon them to figure out sooner rather than later what they’re going to do, and how they're gonna put it together, but you can’t really know, anyway, ‘cause life’s gonna’ take turns. There’re gonna be jobs that don’t exist now that you will end up doing, and that's certainly what happened to me.
John Aubry & Kathryn Vincent::  I mean... I'm- one could say, I am a librarian, but that’s so different a thing than it was when- My colleagues here at Grinnell were- would be doing totally different things. Lives are totally spent with computers now, which was not the case at that time.
Kathryn Vincent & John Aubry::  The last question is: if you were writing a history of Grinnell College, what would you include from your years here?
John Aubry & Kathryn Vincent::  And we just talked about this, and carried it around, and it happened and I understand it became a real tradition that continues on. So…
Kathryn Vincent & John Aubry::  Alright, anything else you want to say? Stories?
